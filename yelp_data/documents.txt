If I could eat a southwestern Caesar salad once a day , every day , I think I would .|&|This is one of my favorite salads ... ever .|&|Paradise in general is a little overpriced but one in a while , I 'll bite the bullet and splurge .|&|My only complaint is their lack of vegetarian options .|&|For a restaurant that specializes in soups , salads and sandwiches , it would make sense to have more than one or two options in each category suitable for veggies .
I really do enjoy Whole Foods and the only reason I do n't do my primary grocery shopping here is because of the expense .|&|However , I frequent WF for their salad and hot bars during lunchtime .|&|Again , not cheap but the food is fresh and the 'menus ' are changed daily .|&|There is always one vegetarian soup option ( sometimes hard to find ) and the salad bar is a light option when one does n't indulge on the amazing veggie samosa or mashed potatoes .|&|Maybe one day I will suck it up and start buying everyday food here .|&|Until that day , I can not justify spending $ 3.99/lb on peaches : )
The pros : Designer clothing/shoes for crazy low prices They are usually well staffed and the checkout line moves quickly The cons : Survival of the fittest -- some people get insane in here ( watch out in the shoe aisles and handbag bins ) You 've got to go over your potential purchase with a fine-tooth comb .|&|Some of it is it heavily used and not worth the great discounts
Everything about Sushi Brokers is fine .|&|Nothing stands out as spectacular -- service , food , and prices are all average .|&|There are certainly other places close by I prefer .|&|In a pinch , it 's ok. Blas√© .
Being that I am a vegetarian , there are not many dishes at Red Lobster I can eat anymore .|&|However , I will forever be grateful for the creation of cheddar bay biscuits .|&|My husband and I sometimes make a meal out of side salads and their biscuits !|&|Sounds crazy yet tastes delicious .|&|The service at this location is average , not great but not horrible either .|&|It 's close to Old Town Scottsdale and is easy to locate .|&|If you 're in the mood for a big chain meal , this is n't a bad option .
This Starbucks has a drive-thru ... a definite perk .|&|I 've only been there a handful of times but twice they have n't made my iced tea correctly .|&|When it was done right , it was delicious but it 's not a hard order .|&|I prefer my normal location on McClintock and Guadalupe but will come here in a pinch .
Definitely a diverse shop .|&|Pictures of MLB players line the walls .|&|There was a TV tuned to ESPN .|&|There were eight chairs but only three people cutting .|&|There was no shortage of customers .|&|We walked in at the right time as the wait was less than 10 minutes .|&|The wait was probably at least 1 hour long by the time we walked out .|&|The prices for haircuts range from $ 12-18 .|&|They also offer other services like hot towel shaves .|&|Results : Not the best haircut but it 's passable .|&|They are open on Sundays , which is a big plus .
A standard Courtyard Marriott ...|&|This location has an updated lobby with The Bistro ( food/coffee/beer & wine ) .|&|The parking lot has plenty of ( free ) parking .|&|The wi-fi is complimentary and offers decent speeds .|&|The rooms were really clean and the beds were comfy .|&|Location wise - Super convenient access to I-77 .|&|Starbucks , Jack in the Box , Sonic & Wendy 's are within walking distance .
2.5 stars - Somewhere between meh and ok ...|&|The quality of the filet is the only thing that gets this review rounded up to three stars .|&|Read on for more details .|&|We decided to catch an early dinner ( after skipping breakfast and lunch ) on Saturday .|&|I made easy reservations on Open Table for 5pm .|&|When we pulled up , both of us were pretty surprised by the exterior .|&|The restaurant was in a newer looking strip mall , next to a nail salon .|&|Not the swanky digs that I was expecting .|&|We walked inside to an empty restaurant , as they had just opened .|&|The host , who turned out to be our waiter , asked us if we had reservations .|&|Yes , we did .|&|We were seated at a small two top by the wall .|&|I guess they could n't spare a more roomy table .|&|The interior of the restaurant felt like they wanted to make it look and feel upscale on a budget .|&|So , Hot Stone Grill 's schtick is kind of like a fondue restaurants .|&|Switch out the hot pot for a 600 degree volcanic stone .|&|Given this description , you would figure that the food would come out raw and you would get to cook it .|&|Well , that was n't quite true .|&|The filet came seared on both sides , sitting on the stone .|&|The shrimp and scallops came cooked but sitting on the stone cooking further .|&|I was hoping to get the ahi tuna but they did n't have any .|&|The fish selection was salmon and mahi mahi .|&|But after reading the negative review about the quality of the fish , I decided on shrimp and scallops instead .|&|In hindsight , I wish I had just ordered a filet .|&|The quality of the filet was excellent , and it was kitschy fun to be able to sear the meat on the stone before eating it .|&|We like our meat rare so we pushed the meat off the stone and threw it back on just before eating .|&|I 'm not sure what the big hoopla is over their demi glace .|&|It was pretty bland .|&|I preferred the peppercorn sauce , which had much more flavor .|&|The sauces that came out with the seafood were both ok .|&|The seafood was very bland , only having been seasoned by salt .|&|The sides were soooo boring .|&|The mashed potatoes seemed like those out of a box .|&|The veggies of the day were overcooked , underseasoned , sauteed yellow bell pepper strips , onions , and zucchini .|&|Very disappointing for a place that charges $ 30 per plate .|&|I was also surprised that they did n't offer a bread basket or something .|&|I feel like that is really par for the course .|&|Our waiter was ok , just really awkward .|&|He was trying way too hard .|&|I mean who tells a customer to come up to look at the beer selection ... should n't you have a list or something .|&|He hovered and tried to make awkward conversation .|&|Overall , we wo n't be returning .|&|While the filet was very good , there are much better places to visit for the price .
True to their name , World of Beer is precisely that .|&|You would be hard pressed to find a bar with a greater selection of beer .|&|There is truly something for everyone !|&|Light , dark , foreign , domestic , craft , cider ...|&|There are lots of TVs to watch the game ( what game ?|&|any game . )|&|on .|&|The interior is split into two different areas .|&|The front area has a long bar that wraps around .|&|The tap handles also wrap around the wall .|&|I was amazed at how many taps they had !|&|The back area is very comfy and a bit quieter .|&|They also have a great , little patio to enjoy when the weather is nice .|&|The servers were all pretty friendly .|&|My only complaints , it was pricey and parking was challenging .|&|You can find their daily draught selection online .|&|You can see if they have a favorite on tap before you go .|&|Trivia night is on Wednesdays .|&|Need a bite to eat to go with that beer ?|&|No worries .|&|There are nearby restaurants that deliver .|&|On some days , a food truck parks right outside .|&|I 'd return but I wo n't be a frequent visitor .
Overall , it 's A-OK but I was n't blown away and probably would not return .|&|If you are looking for a meat coma , this is the place to go .|&|Chima is like every other rodizio grill - extensive salad bar , various appetizers , and servers walking around with skewered meats .|&|The salad bar was n't as good as other Brazilian Steakhouses I 've been to .|&|The meats that were served were pretty good .|&|The flank steak was excellent .|&|I did n't care for the swordfish .|&|It was really overcooked/dry .|&|Thank goodness for restaurant week , as I would have been sorely disappointed paying the normal $ 50+ per person .|&|At $ 30 per person ( $ 39.50 if you want the full meat rotation ) , I still felt shorted but not as bad .|&|Buffets/AYCE places are really not my style , I never feel like I eat my money 's worth .|&|My biggest complaint mirrors that of Kieran M. 's it totally feels like a whirlwind .|&|We sat down , got our drinks , went up to the salad bar , and then BAM ...|&|The meat started rolling in .|&|Not even 20 minutes later I was done ...|&|Stick a fork in it !|&|Luckily , parking is n't a problem because they offer complimentary valet .
On the smaller side compared to other REI 's .|&|Their selection reflects their size .|&|Not nearly as many options for shoes as the larger stores .|&|Employees seemed pretty friendly for the most part .
Pros : - Cheap ( $ 12 for a haircut or blow out ! ! )|&|Cons : - Carve out at least 1 1/2 to 2 hours ...|&|The stylists are still students so they work under the direction of `` educators . ''|&|There are only a few of them on the floor and every student needs to have their work approved before and after .|&|- Parking is free in the garage behind the building but it can get full I feel like going to the Aveda Institute is a bit like playing roulette ... 50/50 chances that you get an awesome stylist late in their training that does wonders to your hair or you get a total newb ...|&|I really enjoyed the blow out that I had .|&|It was a total steal and looked great but it took FOREVER ... My stylist was nice and did a great job but I ended up being late to the event I was getting styled for !|&|1 hour and 45 mins from start to finish ...|&|I do n't know that I would ever take the gamble on getting my hair cut here but I 'll definitely be back for a blow out .
I recently ran out of protein powder and needed to restock .|&|I used to shop at Max Muscle back in Colorado , but the closest one is in Raleigh so I headed into GNC to find a replacement .|&|This store was small but well stocked .|&|The employee was helpful but not overly pushy or salesy .|&|He asked me what I was looking for and a few other clarifying questions and made a suggestion .|&|I ended up buying what he suggested .|&|What sold me was the satisfaction guarantee .|&|It takes away the fear of getting stuck for 5 lbs of awful tasting protein powder .|&|Their prices seemed competitive and you can get a 15 % off coupon for signing up for their emails .|&|If you shop here often consider signing up for the GNC Gold card for additional discounts .|&|I still like the stuff from Max Muscle better but this location is dfinitely more convenient .
The short review ...|&|Tons of TVs and crappy bar food .|&|I 'll echo other Yelpers and endorse the BBQ chicken nachos .|&|Skip the burger ... overpriced and underwhelming .|&|Keep your expectations realistic and you 'll be happy with Icehouse .
While it is my `` local '' Starbucks , it is hard to be in love with this location .|&|I 've just experienced better at many other locations .|&|I wish parking did n't suck so much and the employees were friendlier .
Nice , clean store with a good selection .|&|One of the better Harris Teeter 's in the area .|&|The parking area can get very full and they do n't have a Starbucks inside this location .
Headline : Simple , little fro yo shop .|&|Almost too simple for my taste .|&|They were closed last time I tired to visit .|&|I found out that they were remodeling .|&|I learned they recently changed ownership .|&|The interior is small .|&|They had a list of fro yo flavors on a chalk board .|&|Some of them said scoop next to the flavor .|&|I was confused , so the guy at the counter clarified that they actually scoop the fro yo out of a container .|&|That 's a first for me .|&|I tried the original tart and the peanut butter chocolate , which was scooped .|&|I did n't much care for the texture of the scooped fro yo .|&|The original tart was nice and tart so I went with that .|&|I was n't the largest fan of the texture .|&|A bit too icy for my taste .|&|Their pricing is set by size but I did n't like how they charge 50 cents per topping .|&|A cup of fro yo can get pricey quick that way .|&|I was intrigued by the taro mochi but disappointed after trying it .|&|Way too gummy in texture and , except for being purple , did n't remind me of taro at all .|&|I 'd be willing to try them again next time I 'm up in Noda , but they do n't make my list of favorites for fro yo .|&|Note : Seating is a challenge and the sidewalk outside the shop gets really crowded when it 's busy .
Since moving to Charlotte , I have been on a hunt to find places to satisfy the random cravings of my Denver staples .|&|One of those cravings are arepas from the Quiero Arepas food truck .|&|If you ever find yourself in Denver , make sure you track them down !|&|So , I found Arepas Grill ( thanks , Yelp ! )|&|and I headed down to check them out .|&|Just a note ...|&|The street address on Yelp is wrong .|&|It is located at 4740 Old Pineville Rd # A .|&|Right next to it 's sister restaurant , Colombian Bakery .|&|I walked in and the place was empty .|&|No seriously , there were n't any employees ...|&|I waited for a solid three minutes until someone showed up to help me out .|&|Which was fine , as it gave me time to look over the menu .|&|I decided on the Carne Mechada arepa ( $ 6.00 ) and maracuya ( passion fruit ) drink ( $ 3.00 ) .|&|He took my order and disappeared to the back .|&|He reappeared a bit later with a freshly made arepa .|&|He proceeded to cut it open and stuff it with the shredded beef and cheese .|&|I asked for the spicy , avocado sauce that I am accustomed to having my arepa served with .|&|The passion fruit drink was awesome !|&|Very fresh tasting and refreshing .|&|I 'm on the fence about the arepa .|&|I like how fresh the arepa itself was , but I was n't really impressed with the fillings .|&|It was definitely tasty , but I am used to my arepas being fixed up with more than just meat and cheese .|&|A little more garnish would have put them over the top !|&|This place could definitely earn the fourth , and even fifth , star easily with a little bit of improvement .|&|They should take a look at Quiero Arepas menu !|&|I would be psyched if they added something like the La Havana to their menu !|&|I 'll visit Arepas Grill next time an arepa craving strikes !
I 'm feeling *HOT* HOT *HOT* They told me that they have the hottest studio in town .|&|That 's no joke .|&|Classes are short and sweet .|&|You definitely get your sweat on .|&|Look for discount deals on their website and daily deal sites .|&|They seem to always be running something .|&|Bring a mat , towel and water and you 'll be set .
Overall , Rhino Market is Common Market 2.0 Less hipsterish .|&|Cleaner .|&|A slightly older crowd .|&|But pretty much the same concept .|&|The chicken torta was good but the roast beef was better .|&|Enjoyed a glass of wine and a beer with the sandwiches .|&|I was n't blown away by anything at Rhino Market but I 'd try it again .
The good : Chicken & apple sausage .|&|Yum !|&|The bad : VERY limited gluten free options .|&|The waitress was n't willing to work with me .|&|I ended up ordering off the a la carte menu .|&|How difficult would it be to add a plate with eggs + protein + fruit/side .
Ah Dunkin Baskin ... Donuts and ice cream under the same roof .|&|Diabetes through the door .|&|It can be a pain in the butt to get to though if you are heading south on South .|&|Service is always efficient and friendly !|&|They get the job done .
Like many other Mills malls , this one is HUGE .|&|It is a 1.4 million-square-foot behemoth filled with a 24 screen + IMAX theater , dining options , and tons of retail/outlet/factory stores .|&|This place is a zoo on weekends .|&|Filled to the brim with tourists looking to score some bargains .|&|I would recommend avoiding it ...|&|If you want to shop without the crowds , go on a weekday .|&|Let me tell you a little secret about factory stores ... Executives have gotten wise to consumers looking for a good deal .|&|These companies actually create specific items to sell exclusively at factory stores ( lower quality = lower cost ) .|&|Banana Republic , Coach , Eddie Bauer , Gap ( and many more ) are all guilty of it ...|&|If you are looking for bargain deals on full price merchandise ( likely from last season ) , go to a true outlet store ( TJ Maxx , Off 5th , etc ) .
Michaels is every Pinteresters dream store .|&|They have every crafty item needed .|&|Block of floral foam .|&|Got it .|&|Giant glass martini glass .|&|Check .|&|Baking supplies to make that Rainbow Cake .|&|Yup , that too .|&|My dislikes ...|&|It is cluttered and disorganized .|&|The staff does n't really seem to know what 's going on either .|&|But there is ALWAYS a sale .|&|Never pay full price at Michaels .|&|There is always a 40-50 % off coupon you can get in the Sunday paper or online .
Petal is a really cool boutique in South End .|&|They offer classy but trendy pieces at reasonable prices .|&|The three star review is based on their return/exchange policy .|&|Their current policy is 14 days for store credit or exchange only .|&|I do n't mind the short time frame but I am not a fan of the store credit only option .|&|If you are going to have such a return/exchange window , please consider offering a refund option .|&|I would definitely shop there more if the updated their policy .
There is n't much to love or hate about Amos ' .|&|It 's really just A-OK. Live music .|&|[ check ] - They have an interesting lineup - tons over tribute and cover bands .|&|Cheap admission .|&|[ check ] - Sometimes free ! .|&|Decent prices on drinks [ check ] - $ 3.75 for domestics , $ 4.75 for `` premium '' beers Free parking [ check ] - I guess that 's a pretty big plus in Southend Dive-y Music Hall [ check ] - The acoustics are n't anything to write home about but they do just fine .
Ubiquitous .|&|Once you have been one , you 've really been to them all .|&|The brown bread is great .|&|The wait is atrocious during peak hours or prom season .|&|The cheesecake is good but at $ 8 a slice , you can do better elsewhere .
I 'm really in love with Sycamore 's space .|&|Sycamore is easily accessible - located right off the Light Rail trail and they have a large parking lot ( rare in the area ) .|&|The beer can often leave a lot to be desired .|&|I just have n't found anything that I 'm in love with .|&|I 'll definitely be back to hang out in the large , open space or to listen to live music on their awesome patio .
Local greasy spoon with friendly service and good prices .|&|Nothing super special but a solid choice over IHOP or Denny 's .
It 's a bar .|&|There are tons of TVs to watch games and bar food to fill your belly .|&|Service and prices are both on par .|&|Nothing to rave about in either way .
RockSalt has so much potential but is really just ok .|&|I 've been twice and walked away both times feeling like it could have been better .|&|They always seem to be having some $ 1 oyster special so be on the look out for those days/times .|&|I 'd like to see the service step it up a bit .
Add another barcade to the ever expanding selection around Charlotte .|&|This one takes the place of Bar Charlotte .|&|Close your eyes and take away the game machines , it 's like you are still there .|&|Any child of the 90 's will appreciate the atmosphere .|&|It 's a fun spot to hit in Uptown if you want to do something besides drink and dance .
Tacos .|&|Tequila .|&|Whiskey .|&|How could that combo be bad ?|&|I was truly hoping that Bakersfield could be `` the '' place that replaced the likes of Pinche Taco in Denver .|&|The evening did n't start well .|&|Parking is a hot mess but that is just the area .|&|They do offer complimentary valet out of the Berrybrook lot across the street .|&|Limited street parking is it for people that are n't keen on valet .|&|We started with a Don Julio tequila flight , a cerveza and chips & guac ( $ 7 ) .|&|Honestly , I found it irritating that chips and salsa were n't gratis .|&|I really enjoyed the guac .|&|It was super chunky with the right amount of lime , salt and cilantro .|&|They brought bottles of salsa to go with the tacos , so I sampled those with chips .|&|The green salsa was incredibly mild and slightly bland .|&|The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and subtle spiciness .|&|We ordered an assortment of tacos - pork belly pastor , fish taco , short rib , and a spicy pork .|&|They were served family style on a platter .|&|The food had a visual appeal but none of them blew me away .|&|Especially for $ 4 a pop .|&|Overall , they were close to meeting the 4 star mark .|&|Drop the prices and bring me chips & salsa on the house .
I 've been to my fair share of beer fests but never a Beer , Bourbon & BBQ fest .|&|So imagine my excitement when I was able to get my hands on some VIP tickets !|&|We showed up right around 12:00 .|&|There was a fairly long line of people wearing neon colored wrist bands .|&|We got our ID 's checked and we joined the line of thirsty patrons .|&|In exchange for a small ticket , they hand you your sampling glass .|&|About half the festival was laid out on the parking lot with the rest opening out to the park .|&|It was a warmer day , so the shade that the trees provided were a welcome refuge .|&|Many people brought their own blankets , folding chairs and some even had coolers .|&|There were a few people with pretzel necklaces and even a guy in costume .|&|Various vendor tents handing out swag filled in the spaces between sampling tents .|&|Our fair city 's CM was out there too !|&|I 'm glad that we were able to get the VIP tickets for the extra hours ( 12-2 ) before the general admission crowd is let in .|&|The lines grew substantially after 2pm and vendors had already run out of things by then ( like the high end bourbon table ) .|&|If you want to beat the crowds and have the full gamut of choices , spend the extra $ 10 on the VIP tickets .|&|So , why three stars you may ask ?|&|My biggest complaint mirrors that of Mac K 's , how are you going to call a festival Beer , Bourbon and BBQ and only represent two of three things ...|&|There was plenty of beer & bourbon ( and other spirits ) but there were only two BBQ vendors ( Queen City Q and one I do n't remember the name of ) and no samples .|&|Luckily , they offered re-entry and you could just walk over to the mall for more food options ( and bathrooms & air conditioning ! ) .|&|If you are a beer and bourbon fan , it 's worth attending .|&|I just was n't wowed enough to pay the ticket price for next year .
Maybe we went on an off day/time , but Sabor was n't that great .|&|We went in on a Wednesday around 7:00pm .|&|It was pretty quiet inside with only one other table occupied .|&|We walked in and saw the order counter in front of us , two large LCD 's displaying the menu above , and coolers full of beer on the left .|&|They had a good selection of craft and Mexican beers .|&|The decor was plain and simple .|&|Nothing exciting .|&|We ordered , paid , and sat down .|&|Not long after , they called my name and we picked the food up at the counter .|&|The food : Arepa - The star of the plate !|&|Tender , well seasoned chicken stuffed inside a fresh corn flatbread and topped with cheese .|&|I would go back just for this !|&|It is a sizable portion , too .|&|Pupusa - Spinach and cheese filled .|&|I was largely unimpressed with this .|&|It was really dry and kind of hard , like it had been reheated .|&|Empanda - Chicken and cheese filled .|&|Unfortunately , the chicken was dry and the filling was under-seasoned .|&|It outside was nicely cooked .|&|Taco Authentico - Steak .|&|Not too bad but not that exciting .|&|Chips - Warm .|&|Thick .|&|Seasoned ( but not evenly ) .|&|I was ok with them but they were n't my favorite .|&|Salsa bar - I was largely unimpressed with the salsa bar .|&|The ice was all melted and most of the containers were empty .|&|It definitely did not look like it did in Ben G. 's photo .|&|Three of the salsas were in squeeze bottles .|&|The hot salsa was hot enough to burn your face off .|&|I 'm not a hot/spicy food whimp by any means , but this was straight up burn with no flavor .|&|Extremely underseasoned .|&|The taste reminded me of habaneros that had been blended and bottled .|&|Not my favorite .|&|The salsa verde was supposedly hot but it was n't that spicy and also flavorless .|&|The best out of the batch was the pink sauce .|&|It was n't so much a salsa as a crema .|&|I 'm not really sure how the pickled onions and cabbage constituted a salsa .|&|I like the concept of Sabor but their food just did n't impress me .|&|I 'd be willing to give them another shot .|&|Maybe I 'll try the burrito next time .
The price is right and so is the location .|&|Cookies were ok but not mind blowing good .|&|I tried the double chocolate chip , chocolate chip walnut and chocolate chunk .|&|The chocolate chunk was by far the best of the three .|&|There was a lot of choco chunks and they were still a little gooey .|&|Yum !|&|I was n't that big of a fan of the chocolate chip walnut .|&|There were lots of walnuts on top but the cookie was almost cakey with not enough choco chips .|&|The double choco cookie was fine .|&|A bit flat , in flavor and literally .|&|For around 65 to 70 cents per cookie , go check it out for yourself .
Charlotte has a serious lack of authentic Korean restaurants .|&|We gave Miyagi 's a shot but it fell short .|&|For those looking for authentic Korean food and flavors , head down to PePeRo in Matthews .|&|If you are looking for a hip Asian fusion spot in NoDa , you found it .
Ginbu is a quaint spot off Providence .|&|The interior is small but nicely decorated .|&|They offer sushi and Chinese dishes .|&|On this visit , we only ordered sushi rolls .|&|Out of the four rolls that we ordered , none were particularly memorable .|&|The fish was fresh but all the rolls were plain .|&|We usually enjoy more innovative/inventive rolls and combinations .|&|If I happen to be close by and in the mood for sushi , I 'd stop again but it wo n't be a go-to spot .
Convenient location but not so great if you try to mail things during peak hours .|&|I went in to post things during the holidays and they only had one window open !|&|I wish they had a self-service machine .|&|The plus ...|&|They saved me a TON of money .|&|UPS quoted me $ 131 to send a package for guaranteed Christmas Eve delivery .|&|USPS only charged me $ 22 .
Whoa .|&|I really love pop-ups but this one left a little to be desired .|&|It was just too crowded .|&|They advertised free bubbly to the first 100 people .|&|The actual execution was pretty terrible .|&|There were people that were in line much longer that did n't get any bubbly because it was so disorganized .|&|We did n't ' stay long because it was so crowded .|&|I hope they do a better job of planning it next year !
Yoforia delivers fro yo to the masses in Southpark Mall .|&|It 's a self serve spot with 12 flavors .|&|Unfortunately , two were down for cleaning when I visited .|&|You can sample as many flavors as you like but you need to ask the people at the counter for the cups .|&|They keep them hidden , probably to deter people from just snagging samples and leaving without a purchase .|&|I sampled a few and enjoyed most of them .|&|Most of the ones I sampled had a really nice , smooth consistency ( read , not icy ! ) .|&|They had a nice mixture of sweet and tart flavors .|&|They had 4 tart flavors out of the 10 they were serving at the time Which is more than most places offer .|&|The thing that got me ... TARO fro-yo .|&|Oh yum yum ! !|&|It was a nice consistency , which an appealing purple hue .|&|The taro flavor was mild but ever present .|&|I also enjoyed the key lime and cheesecake swirled together .|&|Like most self-serve fro-yo places , they only have one size cup ( large ! ) .|&|So , be careful filling it up .|&|Otherwise , you will , very easily , have an $ 8+ cup in your hands .|&|The toppings bar was messy and the fruit did n't look all that appealing .|&|I opted to pass on toppings , as the taro was good all on its own .|&|So , my biggest complaint ... Price !|&|I know they have to pay the rent , which is probably outrageous being in a mall , but come on !|&|They charge about 10 cents more per ounce than comparable self-serve fro yo places .|&|Oh well ...|&|I 'll be back just for the taro fro-yo .
Juice Bar is a great spot to pop in and pick up a healthy pick me up .|&|My favorites are the Ginger Greens and Coffee Janet Smoothie .|&|The service is friendly and I 've never had to wait long to order or get my juice .|&|So , why three stars ?|&|Inconsistency .|&|It seems that the smoothies taste different depending on who makes them .|&|I 'd love to see more consistency in what I 'm getting .|&|Especially when I 'm paying over $ 7.00 for a smoothie .
Overall , Menchie 's in a decent fro-yo option in the Dilworth area .|&|Plenty of flavors to try .|&|Most are sweet with only 2 tart options when I visited .|&|The flavors do rotate .|&|I liked the consistency , not too creamy and not icy .|&|Some of the flavors definitely made me think soft serve and not fro yo ... Good ?|&|Bad ?|&|Undecided .|&|But I noticed that it melted really fast .|&|By the time I dispensed it into my cup , put the toppings on , and paid for it , there was a decent melted pool in the bottom of my cup .|&|That made me a little sad .|&|They had some samples of their fresh made waffle cones/bowls .|&|Delish .|&|I would definitely recommend their waffle products !|&|I teeter totter between liking self-serve vs. full serve fro yo places .|&|Menchie 's is a self-serve joint .|&|Which means : a ) You can sample as many flavors as you want .|&|Just grab the small paper sample cups on the counter .|&|b ) You can put all 12 flavors in one cup if you so desire c ) You can top away and decorate to your hearts desire .|&|But I must warn you , self serve places definitely have their negatives .|&|a ) So , when you pay by the ounce you got ta be careful how much you put in that cup .|&|They only offer one size cup , which is quite large ( ! )|&|and easy to fill if you are n't swift handed with the dispensing lever .|&|The toppings bar is quite dangerous as well ...|&|Fill up your cup too much and you may be walking away with an $ 8 cup of fro yo .|&|My cup was around $ 5 and I felt like I went pretty easy filling up the cup .|&|It was maybe 1/2 full .|&|b ) Toppings are also self-serve ...|&|I try not to think of the bogger picking little fingers that have been all over those scoops .|&|But hey , some germs never killed anyone right ... think of it as free immune system training !|&|c ) The toppings bar options were n't that great/healthy .|&|They had plenty of dry toppings - crushed cookies , cereal , gummi bears , choco chips , and many other hfcs laden options .|&|But I thought the fresh fruit area was lacking .|&|The fruit I saw was cut into large , unappealing chunks and some of it did n't look all that fresh .|&|While not my favorite fro yo joint in the QC , it does deserve a mention .|&|I like this location better than other Menchie 's locations I 've visited ( it 's a franchise ) .|&|Sign up for a Smileage card if you are a frequent visitor .
Heist is cool ...|&|Sometimes a bit too cool ...|&|The beer is fantastic but the food is hit or miss .|&|High prices for small portion sizes ( tapas style ) eats that are meh .|&|Squeezing hummus and goat cheese out of a metal roll tube ...|&|I 'll pass .|&|Brunch was a swing and a miss .|&|Buffet style with food that just did n't do it .|&|Go for the beer and atmosphere .|&|Eat somewhere else .
Convenient little store with all the things you 'd expect .|&|Easy to pop in and out of with street parking right out front .
A-OK is a very accurate description of my experience at CO .|&|The interior is beautiful .|&|It was a pleasure just being seated .|&|The food was ok .|&|The beef and kimchi dumplings were fine .|&|The sauce that they brought was awesome though .|&|The Vietnamese ramen was weird .|&|I did n't much care for it .|&|Our server was clearly new and a little awkward .|&|Overall , for the price paid , I was n't impressed .
Dollar Tree is my go to destination for stocking stuffers .|&|I 'm always amazed at the variety of objects stocking the shelves .|&|There are some decent deals hidden but for the most part the quality sucks .|&|Buyer beware : the items are priced at $ 1 because the quantity is lower .|&|So price per item may be lower , but price per ounce will be higher than at other stores .
Bad Daddy 's is my favorite burger spot .|&|I love the taste and quality of their food .|&|This location is situated in Birkdale Village .|&|They have a nice large dining area and great outdoor patio .|&|Parking is ample and service is good .|&|So why three stars ?|&|I think the food is just better at their Easy Blvd location .
Charlotte Premium Outlets really delivers on the outlet shopping part .|&|It is an outdoor setup similar to the other Premium Outlet locations .|&|The store selection is good and the layout was fine .|&|My biggest problem was the parking lot .|&|It was a nightmare to navigate and there were a ton of pissed off shoppers trying to get in and out .
Juan Taco is a cute little food cart but I did n't much care for the tacos .|&|They were ok ... Not bad but not good either .|&|Ordered the carne mechada tacos ( 3 tacos for $ 8 no side ) .|&|The shredded beef was kinda tough and not that exciting .|&|The corn tortillas were just warmed up , store bought ones .|&|The toppings did n't add much - shredded cabbage and cheese .|&|It 's a good thing they were served with hot sauce .|&|Juan Taco could be pretty awesome if they stepped it up a bit !
Centrally located in midtown at the Met , BJ 's recently opened up the world of warehouse shopping to many .|&|Previously , the closest locations were too far from center city .|&|The membership sales team has been slanging memberships at discounted rates to lure new shoppers in .|&|+ 's : Location and convenience Use any major credit card Use manufacturer coupons ( stack on top of BJs coupons for more savings ) - 's : Selection is vast but Costco 's is better Smaller sizes of items = lower unit price but Costco prices are better No gas station Overall : I much prefer shopping at Costco but the convenience of BJs will win out sometimes .
This review is for the Halloween Haunted Trail event ONLY !|&|The Latta Plantation runs this event the Friday and Saturday before Halloween only .|&|We arrived at around 7:45pm and we did n't start the trail walk until 9:00pm .|&|The walk itself took about 10-15 minutes to get through .|&|The experience was part historical reenactment and part haunted house .|&|They took us in small groups between 10-15 with a guide in the front and in the back .|&|They were the only ones with flashlights .|&|There were a few roots that you need to watch out for .|&|The little kids were pretty freaked out .|&|The event itself was pretty cheesy but it was all put on by volunteers and the proceeds all benefit the preservation of the Plantation .|&|The event promised to have OMB pouring on site but they backed out the day of .|&|No fault of Latta Plantation but it would have made the 1+ plus wait more bearable .
Lunch Review : We pulled up at 11:45 am to discover that they did n't open till 12 for lunch .|&|We waited patiently in the car .|&|At 12 pm , the sign flipped to open and a people started emerging from their car to walk in .|&|The restaurant itself is pretty tiny .|&|There were a few booths , two small 2-top tables , a few larger tables pushed together and a separate , traditional dining area for larger parties .|&|They had their lunch special A and lunch special B out to view on a table near the register .|&|I ordered the lunch special A - rice with beef on top and a smaller bowl of pork ramen .|&|The beau ordered the miso ramen .|&|Overall , I enjoyed my food and he enjoyed his .|&|It really was n't anything to rave about though .|&|Pretty standard .|&|Definitely not the best ramen I 've had , but hey ...|&|It was Charlotte good .|&|A few things I found annoying ...|&|The floors were slightly sticky feeling and the service was curt at best .|&|I wo n't be going out of my way to return unless i have a huge hankering for ramen .
Overall , nice , clean layout and decent selection .|&|BR is one of those stores that I know I 'll find something I like .|&|They are always running sales , which is nice .|&|My favorites are when they do 40 % off your entire purchase or their suiting sales .|&|I feel like you should never pay full retail on anything at BR .|&|This location recently reopened after a renovation .|&|I heard that the roof collapsed sometime last year and it has been closed for a while .|&|They did a good job with the renovation .|&|The store was very clean and I liked the layout .|&|The dressing rooms were nice and roomy , although it could have had better lighting .|&|The employees were n't super helpful but a few were friendly .
Love the weird stuff you can find here .|&|Prices are inconsistent at best .|&|But that means you can score some serious deals if you are willing to dig .|&|a Hate selling stuff here .|&|It feels like you get robbed anytime you sell here .|&|If you want to maximize your selling experience , make sure your clothes are in season and trendy or weird enough .|&|And do n't expect to make bank .|&|Parking can suck .|&|Just park in the lot across the street and walk over .
It looks like a Starbucks .|&|It tastes like a Starbucks .|&|But do n't let it fool you ...|&|It 's not a real Starbucks .|&|It 's a license store operated by Target .|&|There are subtle differences that most people wo n't notice or care about .|&|Like they wo n't honor certain promos from Starbucks corporate and they use Target brand Market Pantry milk .|&|But the location is super convenient if you need a little pick me up before hitting Target 's aisles .|&|The drinks are usually good but service can be hit it miss .|&|Sometimes the employees are really friendly and other times they are pretty frazzled and short .|&|Overall , it 's a-ok in my book .
I do n't get the love affair with Red Clay .|&|Love that there is a cider spot in Charlotte but their ciders left much to be desired .|&|There was nothing on the taster tray that struck my fancy .|&|Try it for yourself but I think I 'll be sticking to beer .
Ulta is the big-box equivalent of a specialty cosmetic store .|&|Their selection includes `` prestige '' brands like Benefit and normal brands like Revlon .|&|This store also has a salon .|&|My biggest complaint about Ulta is the customer service .|&|I prefer going to Sephora for my specialty cosmetics .
I know a lot of people complain about the food and the service ...|&|But hey ...|&|It is Dave & Buster 's .|&|This one meets the expectation of mediocore food and subpar service .|&|It 's an adult Chuck E. Cheese .|&|Video games , skeeball and booze = a good time for all .|&|I would personally pass on the food and suggest sticking to beer ( they ca n't really mess that up ) .|&|Go for the games , pool , and bowling .|&|Sign up for their emails for free game play coupons or go on Wednesdays for 1/2 priced games .|&|They also kick all the kiddos out at 11pm on the weekends to turn it into an adults only place .
Tons of TVs with run of the mill food bar food .|&|Service is consistent , beers are cheap and there are tons of screens to watch sports on .|&|I 've sampled a few different items but nothing has blown my mind .|&|I do like the sweet potato tots though .|&|The cajun chicken sandwich was n't bad but I wish the bottom piece of bread did n't come out soggy .|&|They have a large dining area , bar seating , a private room that you can reserve if you are bringing a large group and a pretty nice patio with TVs .|&|If you are looking for a sports bar in the area Jocks & Jills is a decent choice .
Overall , fancy Italian in South End with high prices but underwhelming food .|&|Valet - check White tablecloths - check Extensive wine list - check Pricey entrees - check Flavorful , quality food - ...|&|I was very underwhelmed with the food , especially considering how high the prices were .|&|I had the gnocchi ( $ 18 ) , wedge salad , and tried the veal osso bucco ( $ 29 ) .|&|Given the high reviews and prices , I expected the food to be better .|&|It was all fine , but we could have gotten a better meal for half the price that I would have been happier with elsewhere .|&|Save this place for date nights where food is n't the highlight of the evening .
I heard this was a place where you could get Middle Eastern Cuisine , so I thought I would give it a try .|&|I love Lebanese food and I have not found a place on the West Coast that knows how to make shawarma .|&|I was hoping this place did ... nope .|&|First of all you need to have the machine to rotate and cook the lamb .|&|The meat does not taste the same on the grill .|&|Then you need to have a panini grill to toast the sandwich after you roll it up .|&|I still have to go back to Dearborn , Michigan to get a good shawarma sandwich .|&|That being said , I will say they have a cool little hookah lounge .|&|They have nice drink menu and food menu as well .|&|Do n't get me wrong , the food was good .|&|I just want a real shawarma sandwich ! !|&|I think the owners are Israeli , so that would explain the different style of some of the cooking .|&|They make shawarma sandwiches way different .|&|The food is going to vary from country to country in the Middle East , but it 's all basically the same stuff .|&|Anyways , the place looked clean and the food is good .|&|I would recommend trying it out .
I have been hearing all the talk about hot yoga so , I figured I would give it a try when I saw a deal on Groupon .|&|The instructors here are awesome ! !|&|I tried the yoga class and it was much more difficult then I expected it to be .|&|I never expected that yoga would be such a good work out .|&|You deformity sweat in that room so , bring plenty of water .|&|I also tried the Hot Pilates .|&|It was also a great work out and more intense than the yoga class .|&|It was more of a strength building and muscle toning class .|&|It was much more exhausting than the yoga class .|&|Again , bring plenty of water .|&|The rooms smell disgusting , but I guess that is every Hot Yoga place .|&|Bikram Yoga is just not for me though .|&|It 's just too damn hot !|&|If you enjoy Hot Yoga though , then give this place a try .|&|Do n't forget to bring your yoga mat and your towel .
I had my grips changed here on my golf clubs .|&|I brought my own grips with me , because I ordered the JumboMAX grips online .|&|The charged me $ 3 per club to install the new grips .|&|The guy installing the grips was very busy so I had to leave the clubs there , but he changed the grips on a few of the clubs while I waited so I could go to the range that day .|&|That was very nice of him to do so .|&|I picked up the rest of the clubs the next day and everything was as expected .|&|They also have a large selection of golf gear and accessories .|&|They have all the top brands in clubs too .|&|The staff and the manager here are extremely helpful when you ask questions .|&|Great customer service .
I enjoy having breakfast here once in a while .|&|They have plenty of healthy options .|&|I usually go for the vegan pancakes with carrots , pecans , and agave syrup , along with the veggie hash with egg whites .|&|The veggie hash is served in a skillet .|&|Both are excellent .|&|I also like the MTO break feast with egg whites , chicken sausage , turkey bacon , potatoes , and whole wheat toast .|&|You definitely wo n't be disappointed with your meal .|&|The only complaint I have is the patio tables .|&|I would enjoy dining on the patio , but most of the tables are wobbly and ready to topple over as soon as you place something on them .|&|I am shocked that the manager would allow customers to sit at those tables .|&|That issue needs to be addressed a.s.a.p .
This spot is located in a strip mall across from the Palace Station on W Sahara .|&|The entire front side of the strip mall is under construction and it was not easy finding a parking spot at lunch time .|&|There was about a 15 minute wait in line .|&|The dining area is small , so you may be taking your order to-go if it is busy .|&|We ordered the Angry Tuna , Twin Dragon , and the 3 Amigos .|&|We all chose the seaweed wrapper .|&|Everything was excellent .|&|They were all basically giant hand rolls filled with different items .|&|Most of the rolls are around $ 8 to $ 10 dollars .|&|Definitely worth it .|&|I will be returning to try more menu items .|&|I recommend that you give this place a try .|&|You wo n't be disappointed .
Great store .|&|Pretty much the same as Home Depot .|&|If you ca n't find it here , you can always head to Home Depot .|&|Between the two places , they pretty much have everything you need to remodel your home .|&|I do prefer Home Depot Behr paint over Lowes brand though .
T-bones is located in the Red Rock Hotel & Casino .|&|The restaurant is just inside the doors to the right after you walk in from the East parking garage .|&|It is an upscale dining establishment with cloth napkins and table cloths , but you can dress casually if you choose to do so .|&|They have an elegant dining area and a nice selection of wines to choose from .|&|As expected from a high end steak house it is fairly expensive .|&|The service is excellent .|&|The entire staff is extremely welcoming and friendly from the time you walk through the door until the time you leave .|&|They offer a nice selection of different cuts of meat .|&|The only thing I was disappointed with was only the filet was grass fed .|&|All of the other cuts of meat were just prime cuts that are dry aged .|&|I felt that they should offer more of a selection of grass fed beef for the prices they charge .|&|All of the menu items are ala carte .|&|I had the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye ( rare ) for $ 58 , Big-eye Tuna Poke , Kale Salad , and the Grilled Tomatoes .|&|The 22 ounce bone-in ribeye was supposed to be cooked rare .|&|It was a little over cooked .|&|It was more medium-rare than rare .|&|The steak had excellent flavor and had consistent marbling through out the steak .|&|It was definitely an excellent cut of beef .|&|I would say that it was an excellent steak , even though I would have preferred it to be grass fed .|&|The Big-eye Tuna Poke appetizer was outstanding .|&|The tuna was very fresh .|&|The poke was set over avocado and seaweed .|&|It was drizzled with sweet soy reduction that was also outstanding .|&|The Kale Salad had some crunchy kale chips mixed in the salad with walnuts , gorgonzola cheese , and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing .|&|This was an excellent choice from the salad menu .|&|The salad had great flavor .|&|The side of grilled tomatoes with spinach was pretty good .|&|I think the tomatoes could have been grilled longer , unless they were just put in the oven then that would explain why they did not look grilled .|&|Overall it was an enjoyable dining experience and I would definitely recommend dining here .
Another option for desert in DTS .|&|They have excellent gelato and plenty of flavors to choose from .|&|They also have non-dairy options , which were also excellent .|&|We tried the salted coconut mango , passion fruit , and the chocolate sorbet .|&|They were all excellent .|&|I recommend you stop by and try this place .|&|You wo n't be disappointed .
I finally have decided to stop in here after driving past it nearly everyday .|&|The interior looked much nicer than I expected before I entered the restaurant .|&|There is a small ramen bar in front of the kitchen and a small Japanese themed dining area .|&|The staff were all very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be very clean .|&|The food and the service was better than average .|&|I would definitely recommend giving this place a go .|&|Takoyaki - this was excellent .|&|If you like the Japanese dish Okino Miyaki then you will like this dish .|&|It is basically the same ingredients and then it is shaped in to bite size portions .|&|Crispy Rice with spicy tuna - this is just what it says it is .|&|It was good .|&|Crispy Chicken with ponzu sauce - This would have been a good choice if the chicken would not have been so greasy .|&|I think the oil in the fryer needed to be changed or they dropped the chicken back in the fryer after it was cooked .|&|Spicy chicken ramen noodle - the ramen was excellent .|&|I ordered it `` Hot '' .|&|It had a lot of heat to it , but not so much heat that you could not enjoy it .|&|I may just go with `` Spicy '' next time though .
This restaurant is another spot that is located in the motel on Carson St .|&|If your not looking for it you would probably miss it .|&|It has two levels and a courtyard where you can wait for your table .|&|There is a bar on both levels .|&|You can dine outside when you are seated on the second level .|&|This place gets busy .|&|We waited 40 minutes for a table on a Tuesday night .|&|The food was excellent .|&|We had the Coca Espresso NY Strip .|&|It was cooked perfectly to medium rare and the Demi glaze was outstanding .|&|We also tried the Gyro Tacos , which were good .|&|I will definitely be back to try more menu items .|&|I recommend that you give this place a go .
What I like about this place is their menu does n't have a million items on it , like many Thai restaurants do .|&|It also appears to be very clean and you can view the kitchen from the dining area .|&|The service was also great .|&|The dining area is small , so I would think it fills up pretty quick at lunch and dinner time .|&|The Pad Thai noodles were the best Pad Thai I have had so far .|&|The yellow curry was good .|&|They make it with white potatoes , sweet potatoes , peppers , and onions .|&|I ordered it 5 spicy and that was pretty hot .|&|I might go for 2 next time .|&|The curry was good , but I still think Archie 's yellow curry is the best around Vegas .|&|The roti with yellow curry I did not care for .|&|Actually , the curry was good .|&|It was the bread that I did n't care for .|&|They use a flaky bread that is deep fried .|&|I am use to having baked bread with my roti .|&|I 'm sure it is good if you like fried bread , it 's just not my thing .|&|I will definitely be back for the Pad Thai .
I stopped in to check out the prices on some televisions .|&|They have a lot to choose from , but the prices are better at Costco .|&|They have decent prices on kitchen appliances .|&|I think I will go with Costco .
Henderson Nissan is located in Henderson on Auto Show Drive right off of the expressway .|&|They have a large inventory of vehicles and they have a great sales staff .|&|I bought my 2012 Nissan Maxima from here and I paid way too much for the vehicle , but at least I like the dealership and the staff ... lol .|&|I am very happy with the vehicle .|&|I have not had any major issues with the vehicle and it drives very well .|&|This place has an excellent service center .|&|I still drive all the way here from Summerlin for service and oil changes just because of the quality of the service you receive as opposed to Auto Nation Nissan on W Sahara , which is much closer to my house .|&|I would definitely recommend coming here for service or to purchase a vehicle .
This spot is located just inside the East Doors of the Sun Coast Casino .|&|You head up the escalators and turn right .|&|It sits between the steak house and the Italian restaurant .|&|The dining area is small , but they have a sushi bar type atmosphere where you can sit at the counter and watch your food be prepared .|&|We ordered the oysters on the half shell .|&|I think they were about $ 18 ( reasonable price ) .|&|The oysters were excellent .|&|They were very fresh tasting , but they were gulf coast oysters and I was not aware that they also had cold water oysters available .|&|I would have rather had the cold water oysters , but I did not find out until after dinner when I was talking to the cook .|&|The server should let you know that you have a choice of oysters from different regions when you are ordering .|&|We also ordered the steamed mussels , which came with the standard butter and lemon sauce .|&|The mussels were also very fresh tasting .|&|I ordered the fish & chips for my entree .|&|They use tempura as their batter for the cod .|&|You get two pieces with fries and cole slaw .|&|The fish was pretty good .|&|Was not greasy at all .|&|The cole slaw comes with roasted corn and bacon mixed in it .|&|I do n't eat pork , so one of the cooks mixed me some fresh slaw with just the roasted corn and no bacon .|&|That was nice of him .|&|The service was very good overall .|&|I would say excellent , but they forgot our bread basket .|&|It was also very slow when I was there , so I ca n't say how good or bad the service is when it is busy .|&|I will definitely be back and I would recommend that you give it a try .|&|The total bill was $ 72.00 for a dozen oysters , a dozen steamed mussels , 2 orders of fish & chips , one Blue Moon .|&|and one soda .
Review # 300 4 Stars ***** This place is located in a less than desirable area .|&|It is on Highland Dr near the strip club district .|&|Nonetheless , it was definitely worth the trip .|&|I am giving my 300th review to Rollin ' Smoke BBQ .|&|Definitely a solid 4 star meal when it comes to BBQ beef brisket .|&|I just tried the Brisket 3 Ways which consisted of sliced brisket , chopped brisket , and burnt ends .|&|The meat was very good on its own , but I added some of their Arkansas BBQ sauce to it .|&|I thought their bbq sauce was excellent .|&|They also offered a sweet bbq sauce , but I preferred the tangy version .|&|I also ordered a side of waffle cut fries , which were seasoned very well .|&|I will definitely be back to try the beef ribs and some other menu items .|&|I will probably add another star on my next visit if the beef ribs are as good as the brisket .
The LINQ Hotel & Casino is located on the Las Vegas Strip between The Flamingo and Harrah 's .|&|It is the newly remodeled hotel and casino that used to be The Quad and The Imperial Palace before that .|&|It has come a long way from what it used to be .|&|If you have not been here for a while then you will be pleasantly surprised .|&|The rooms have been renovated as well as all of the hotel towers .|&|The new pool deck is just as nice , if not better than any other pool on the strip .|&|The casino area is probably one of the best spots on the strip to hang out .|&|They have seven gaming pits , a huge slot area , a sports book , and a poker room .|&|There are five bars in the casino .|&|O'Sheas ( Brand New , not the old spot ) , 35/35 Bar , TAG Bar , Squeeze Bar , and The Catalyst Bar .|&|There are several places to eat too .|&|Hash House , Off The Strip , Nook Cafe ' , and Guy Fieri 's are just a few places .|&|I also caught the Matt Franco show a few weeks ago .|&|He was very entertaining .|&|You can walk outside to the Linq Promenade and ride The High Roller too .|&|I definitely recommend that you come to The Linq Hotel & Casino .|&|You will not be disappointed .
It is located on the 23rd floor of The Mandarin Oriental .|&|It is actually next to the hotel reception area .|&|There is not much seating , so I would suggest reservations .|&|Like I said , your on the 23rd floor so you have a great view of the Strip looking North and Northeast .|&|I was there in the afternoon , but I would imagine a night view would be more appealing once the Strip is lit up .|&|For $ 95 ( 18 % gratuity included ) I received two pots of tea , scones , some finger foods , and some pastries .|&|The tea was excellent .|&|We ordered the the Jasmine Pearl and the Mandarin Orange Blossom .|&|They serve honey on the table , but we requested agave syrup and the server brought it to the table .|&|Our server Stephanie was very nice .|&|She kept coming back and checking on us and refilling out tea cups .|&|It was definitely a good time and a nice little snack in between lunch and dinner .|&|I would recommend that you stop in for tea if your in Vegas .
This is my new favorite spot to have a drink downtown .|&|It 's nothing fancy .|&|It 's just a corner bar with a patio , but it is right in the middle of all of the action .|&|We ordered the twig & berries ( new favorite drink ) .|&|I think it is a variation of a Moscow Mule .|&|I will be back just for the drink .|&|We did n't get to try any menu items , but I will definitely be back to try some .|&|I highly recommend that you stop by and chill on the patio .|&|The staff is also very friendly .
This place is a step up from fast food Chinese food .|&|It is pretty good for a quick bite to eat .|&|The only entree I ever order is the Mongolian Beef .|&|You can also see the kitchen from the dining area , I like that .|&|The place appears to be clean .
The food was excellent .|&|The service was also excellent .|&|The food came out to the table very fast .|&|The menu prices are not outrageous like you would expect for a seafood restaurant .|&|$ 15 for a dozen raw oysters .|&|Not bad .|&|The spices on the Gulf shrimp and the clams were very good .|&|It was not that hot for me though .|&|I prefer spicy foods , so it may be hot for some people .|&|The fried oysters were also very good .|&|The raw oysters they serve are from the Gulf of Mexico .|&|I prefer cold water oysters , but these were excellent .|&|The fried shrimp were good , but small .|&|The king crab and the fried calamari were good too .|&|The only complaints I have is that they do not have metal forks to shell the shrimp , so it is a tedious task with the sauce all over the shrimp .|&|It makes it difficult to shell with your fingers or the plastic fork they give you .|&|Next visit I will have to bring my own fork .|&|They also have Green Mussels that are not on the menu .|&|They were good , but they were not cooked long enough and the mussels did not open .|&|I will definitely be back .|&|I look forward to trying the other items on the menu .|&|I would recommend this place if you enjoy seafood .
Regal Cinemas is located in The Red Rock Hotel & Casino .|&|It is next to the food court and near the bowling alley .|&|The best spot to park is in the West Garage .|&|The theater is well maintained and always seems to be clean .|&|There are always plenty of movies to choose from .|&|I think they have about 16 theaters .|&|They have IMAX movies and they have rooms in the theaters if you want to have birthday parties for the kids .|&|The theaters always seem to be kept up very well and the staff is very friendly .|&|The only complaint I have is that sometimes they tell you that you ca n't bring your beverages from the food court in to the movie theater .|&|It is purchased at the Red Rock , so what is the big deal ?
8/2014 Update on my review**** It has been almost one year since I have moved in .|&|There have been a few maintenance issues and I have no complaints whatsoever about how they handled the repairs .|&|-Garbage disposal broke Replaced in a timely manor .|&|-Dishwasher broke Ordered a new dishwasher and replaced the broken one .|&|-There were a few minor repairs that were addressed in a timely manor also .|&|So far , so good .|&|I 'll update the review after the move out .
I had no idea there was a Starbucks near the South Garage in the Red Rock Casino .|&|I have always parked at the opposite end garage or outside .|&|This spot is perfect .|&|There is less traffic on this side of the casino , so you do n't have to wait in line too long .
This is a very well maintained course .|&|Beautiful scenery and a great layout .|&|Unfortunately I seen every end of the course today .|&|I hit the ball all over the place , so I came to appreciate the excellent job the grounds keepers doing with the landscaping ... lol .|&|The is an outstanding golf course and it is located in a beautiful setting .|&|Red Rock Country Club reminds me of some of the nicer courses down in Boca Raton .|&|Great place to golf !|&|!
The Linq is located between the Quad and the Flamingo hotels .|&|As the name suggests , it was created to link the Flamingo and the Quad together .|&|You have access to both hotels from the Linq .|&|There is also access to Las Vegas Blvd .|&|and to Linq Ln .|&|There is an ice cream shop , pizza place , Starbucks , restaurants , ..etc .|&|what I really like about this place is Fuku burger opened a little spot here inside of Fame .|&|Great burgers ! !|&|There is also the Brooklyn Bowl where they have concerts .|&|There is a little bit of everything at the Linq .|&|There is also plenty of self parking options and they offer valet parking .|&|There is outdoor seating at most of the bars and restaurants here too .|&|At the very end , opposite LV Blvd , you can access the High Roller .|&|It is the tallest observation wheel in the world .|&|I have not been on it due to the fact that being up that high makes me sick..lol .|&|Guess I wo n't be reviewing the High Roller .|&|Everyone seems to enjoy it though .|&|I would recommend spending some time down at the Linq and enjoying what it has to offer .
It was about a 2 1/2 hour class for the adult/child/infant CPR/AED certification .|&|John did an excellent job teaching the class .|&|It was very informative .|&|It was only $ 40 .|&|I think the American Ref Cross charges twice as much .
This is a great spot to hit up after the gym .|&|It 's located near LVAC on the South West Side at I-215 & Flamingo .|&|It has ample seating and there are a few tables outside the front door if you want to eat outside .|&|You line up to order your food and they make your food to order as you move down the line .|&|You pick the ingredients you want in your burrito , taco , etc ... .and you pay at the end of the line .|&|I like it here because they have grilled chicken , veggies , brown rice , and other healthy ingredients .|&|You can also get bowls if you do n't want the wraps .|&|The portions are more than enough .|&|I ca n't even finish a burrito there .|&|The tacos are also very good .|&|You get a choice of soft or hard shells .|&|Stop in if you want a healthy meal after the gym .
I have been taking my clothes here since 2007 .|&|They have drive thru service and a very friendly staff .|&|They also have same day service if you drop your clothes off before 9 am .|&|I have not had any issues with cleaning or customer service .|&|They even replaced a button on one of my suit jackets without me even asking - no charge .
This location is located in the Redrock Casino in Summerlin .|&|You can enter the restaurant from the outside without having to go through the casino .|&|Quinoa Apple salad - Excellent !|&|$ 13 Chic Pea Provolone Salad w/ chicken - Was not that great .|&|Too much lemon and bland .|&|$ 19 Charbroiled Octopus - excellent .|&|The lemon taste with the char gave it great flavor .|&|$ 16 Baked Ricotta - Served with toast and honey with truffle oil .|&|Sooo good ! !|&|$ 16 Hanger Steak - The steak was brushed with a truffle oil .|&|Cooked perfect ( med-rare ) .|&|Excellent cut of meat .|&|$ 33 $ 105 for : 2 salads 2 apps 1 entree Overall it was an excellent meal and I would definitely recommend this place .|&|It is quite pricey here though and the portions are small .
I stopped in for lunch .|&|It is Bulgarian food .|&|I had some kind of bean salad .|&|It was pretty good .|&|I also ordered the Bulgarian feta .|&|The Bulgarians make the best feta cheese .|&|You have to try it .|&|It has much more flavor than other feta and has a stronger smell to it .
We stopped in on the second day the park opened .|&|It was on a Tuesday morning , so there was not much of a crowd .|&|Be ready for all the construction if you go during the day .|&|They are still constructing a theater directly across from the park .|&|We tried the original Chicken & Waffle sandwich and the Roasted Mushroom & Grilled Chicken Salad .|&|Both were excellent .|&|You walk in and you order at a counter , as you would at any fast food establishment .|&|Once you order you are given a pager that will vibrate when your order is ready .|&|The server brings your food to you .|&|The servers looked like they were having trouble finding the customers when their orders were ready .|&|They might want to fine tune the order delivery system .|&|I would suggest having the customers pick up their order when the pager is activated .|&|The salad was very good .|&|It had roasted crimini mushrooms , grilled chicken breast , sun-dried tomatoes , goat cheese , romaine , and arugula .|&|The dressing was a lemon and balsamic vinaigrette .|&|The waffle was very light and crispy and it was folded in half with a good sized piece of fried boneless chicken breast on top of cider slaw .|&|The chicken was seasoned well and I think I liked it with the slaw instead of with syrup .|&|It was a nice change from the sweet syrup you usually get on chicken and waffles .|&|Very tasty ! ! !|&|I will definitely be back if I am in the area .|&|I recommend you stop in .|&|You wo n't be disappointed .
This is small place on the corner of Durango & Flamingo .|&|It has a small dining area and a small sushi bar , so it fills up quick .|&|The service here is a little slow and the sushi chefs were not very friendly .|&|The food is great though , so I would recommend trying it out .
I like going to Walgreen over cvs any day .|&|They have more than one register open and you do n't have to wait in line for an hour , as opposed to the hour you spend in line at cvs .|&|The pharmacy staff is pleasant to deal with too .
The Crepe is located in Tavoli Village inside The Market .|&|I was there early Sunday morning and there was street parking available , so I was able to park in front of The Crepe .|&|There is also valet and self parking available .|&|It is small place which also has outside seating .|&|The only complaint I had was the tables were about as big as the plates I usually eat off ... .I 'm a big guy .|&|I get it though ... French .|&|Petite furniture ... .lol .|&|There was also a violinist and a guitar player playing some type of ethnic music .|&|I did not inquire to what type of music they were playing .|&|The menu has a great selection of crepes and if you do not see anything you like , which I am sure will not happen , you can build your own crepe .|&|There are crepes for breakfast , lunch , dinner , and desert .|&|The crepes are named after different regions of the world that best represents the ingredients inside the crepe .|&|I like the fact that they offer whole wheat , buckwheat , vegan , and white crepes .|&|We ordered the following and they were all equally excellent ! !|&|They were served with sides of almond p√¢t√© ' and chili sauce .|&|The almond p√¢t√© ' was awesome !|&|-Mediterranean with a vegan wrap minus the cheese .|&|- Mushrooms , red peppers , tomatoes , spinach , and broccoli .|&|-Brenton - A crepe wrapped around fresh berries and topped with agave syrup .|&|-The Florida - A crepe filled with Key Lime and then toped with crushed graham crackers , Key Lime sauce , and fresh whipped cream .|&|****My Favorite**** The total : 5 crepes 2 coffees 1 orange juice 3 bottled water $ 77.38 I will have to say that crepes are not very filling and I could have eaten about 5 of them by myself , but they were very good .|&|I will definitely be back ! !|&|-- Do n't forget to grab a punch card --
I noticed this new sushi place while I was going to eat at Archie 's next door .|&|I decided to come back and try the new AYCE sushi spot .|&|I was very happy with the quality of the food and the presentation .|&|They have a large selection of rolls to choose from on their menu .|&|The service was a little slow , but I realized it was because they made everyone 's rolls at the table at one time and put them on one large serving plate .|&|I will ask them not to do that next time .|&|The only dish I did not care for was the honey toast .|&|They served us a roll with ice cream and honey .|&|If you want good honey toast , go to Ichiza in China Town .|&|I would definitely recommend eating here .|&|It 's a few dollars more per person than other AYCE places around town , but it was worth it .
Lone Mountain is a nice little hike .|&|It is not difficult if you use the trail on the West side of the mountain .|&|It is still a good work out .|&|The footing is fairly stable most of the way up so you can run up the trail if you so desire .|&|The East side of the mountain is a climb .|&|There is no trail .|&|I only did it because the first time I went there I did not bother to look around the other side for a trail .
Great food and great service .|&|You can see the kitchen from the dining room and the entire restaurant appeared to be very clean .|&|Appetizers : Grilled Spring Rolls ( Chicken , Shrimp , Beef ) The spring rolls were excellent .|&|They were served with fish sauce and peanut sauce .|&|Entrees : Oxtail Soup - The best oxtail soup I have had in quite some time .|&|Vermicelli with Lemongrass beef - it was okay .|&|Kinda bland for my taste .|&|I will definitely be back to try more menu items .|&|I would recommend that you give this place a try .
I was dropping my daughters car off at A 1 Carburetor for repairs and I needed to kill some time , so I checked Yelp for some place to eat while I waited .|&|The Bronze Cafe popped up and I had it booked marked , so I figured I would give it a try .|&|I should have read the reviews and I could have saved myself the trouble of driving in circles looking for the place .|&|It is located inside a LGBTQ community center .|&|I finally figured it out and made my way in .|&|We ordered a couple of pita wraps .|&|We got the tree of life and the good earth .|&|They were both very good .|&|The entire menu looks great .|&|Plenty of healthy options .|&|I am going to try the kale salad ( Bizness ) next time .|&|I would definitely frequent this place if it was in Summerlin , but I will hit it up when I am in the area from now on .|&|The food and service was great .|&|I definitely recommend that you give this place a try .
This is an excellent property management company .|&|When I moved in , the house was clean .|&|Any time there was anything that needed to be fixed , they had a repair person call me the same day .|&|Everyone at the office is nice and helpful .|&|I had no problem getting my security deposit back .|&|As far as the bad review about the maid service , I agree .|&|They were rude and tried to over charge me .|&|When I told the lady she was charging too much , she said that she will wait for Oishi 's to call her after I moved out .|&|I do n't like how she made it seem like I had no choice but to use her service or I would be charged by Oishi 's for a cleaning charge .|&|I did not use the service and I cleaned my own house .|&|I let Oishi 's know about the maid service and that I was not using them .|&|It seems like a scam to me .|&|Other than that , everything else was good .
We got there around 2pm , after the rush .|&|They were out of multi-grain pancakes , sweet potato waffles , and almond milk .|&|No almond milk means no coffee for me .|&|I usually take a star away from any place that runs out of product , but I wo n't this time .|&|The service was excellent and the server was very pleasant .|&|All of our meals were very good .|&|The signature stuffed steak was good .|&|It looked like a piece of sirloin wrapped around a veggie omelette .|&|I should have told them to cook my steak med-rare .|&|My bad .|&|It was very good though and it was served with the house potatoes .|&|The veggie eggs Benedict were also good .|&|I have had better hollandaise sauce .|&|The cornbread waffle and chicken was excellent ! ! !|&|I would recommend that everyone try 's it .|&|You wo n't be disappointed .|&|I will definitely be back to try more menu items and get some more chicken & waffles .|&|I probably want to get there early next time before they run out of multigrain pancakes and almond milk .
Good burgers .|&|I do n't care for the fries .|&|I like the protein burger .|&|Instead of the bun , they wrap it in lettuce .
Smash Burger is my second favorite fast food burger place .|&|Of course Fat Burger is # 1 .|&|They have great burgers and fries here and I like the fact that they offer whole Wheat Buns .|&|The meat tastes better because the way they smash the burger on the grill .|&|It Sears the meat and gives it that distinct taste .|&|I definitely recommend Smash Burger .
Shake Shake in DTS : You order at the counter as soon as you walk in then they give you a pager to notify you when your order is ready .|&|There is plenty of seating in the dining area .|&|The dining area is mostly comprised of booths , with some chairs .|&|The entire place appeared to be very clean .|&|We tried a few different menu items .|&|The bill totaled 43.71 for the following order : 2 - Shack Stack Burger - Good burger , but pretty small for the price .|&|1 - Chicken sandwich - Pretty good chicken sandwich .|&|I like the pepper taste in the batter .|&|Again , small for the price .|&|1 - Chicago Dog - I guess it is good if you like Chicago style dogs .|&|I do n't care for all of the toppings .|&|1 - Chicken Dog - the chicken apple sausage dog was good , but I should not have told them to top it like the Chicago dog .|&|1 - Crinkle Fries - good fries .|&|I like the fact that the chicken served here is free range and all of the meat is natural ( No hormones and no anti-biotics ) .|&|I would recommend trying this place .|&|The burgers and the chicken are worth coming back for .|&|No more Chicago hot dogs for me .
This restaurant has excellent food and the service was excellent as well .|&|It 's located right on the corner of Hualapai and Flamingo .|&|I think it is where Denny 's use to be .|&|They have a sushi bar , dining room , and a section with hibachi tables .|&|They offer a nice menu that 's consists of Japanese dishes , sushi , and Hibachi style cooking .|&|I sat at one of the Hibachi tables .|&|It was the usual show put on like every other Hibachi place , but as always it was funny and entertaining .|&|The filet tasted just fine and it was cooked just they way I requested .|&|The sushi rolls were also very good .|&|As far as the appetizer menu goes , I would definitely recommend the Japanese spring roll and the super white tuna appetizer with jalape√±os .|&|I noticed other items on the menu I would like to order such as ; all of the udon dishes and the Sukiyaki for sure .|&|I think I will be heading back there soon .|&|Stop in and give it a go !|&|!
I 'll start out with that your in DTS , so your gon na pay a little more than usual .|&|This place is worth it though .|&|The chicken was excellent .|&|It did not taste like pre-made frozen chicken strips .|&|This chicken tasted like they just breaded it and dropped it in the fryer .|&|The chicken wings were also very good .|&|There is a variety of different sauces and honey available on the tables .|&|The only thing I did not care for was the fresh garlic in the hot sauce .|&|I love garlic , but not in my hot sauce .|&|You definitely have to stop by and give this place a try .|&|Good food !|&|!
This store has friendly and courteous servers .|&|I never have to wait too long .|&|When they are slow you get your drink in a matter of seconds .|&|Great Starbucks ! !|&|The BAD : Parking sucks !|&|It 's on Spring Mountain Rd and Valley View .|&|Need I say more ? ... ..always traffic and accidents in that area .
I had to come here to get my sheriffs card .|&|I have n't been here for about five years .|&|I remember it being as busy as the DMV .|&|I came here today ( Thursday ) at 2pm and there is no line .|&|Maybe later in the day is the best time to go , or maybe I got lucky .
Excellent sushi ! !|&|This place is located across from the Hard Rock in the CVS Plaza .|&|It is a cool place with a nice atmosphere as far as sushi places go .|&|It is not an AYCE place and it will cost you quite a bit of cash if you eat like you are at an AYCE place , but the sushi is excellent and the staff is very friendly .|&|I use to get sushi to-go from here all the time when I worked in the area .|&|Highly recommend !
I finally went north on the new part of the trail that starts at W Charleston and ends at Cheyenne .|&|Sorry , I was too tired to take photos and it was blazing hot in the sun .|&|So I thought it was going to be a nice steady rise in elevation all of the way up to Cheyenne ... .wrong !|&|In fact , it was the exact opposite .|&|It was smooth sailing all the way to Cheyenne and then I turned around and the fun began .|&|One more thing about this route is that the bridge at Far Hills is much easier to ride over than the bridge at Towncenter Dr. Also , there is only one minor dip under the road at W Lake Mead Blvd .|&|That was a great work out ! !|&|Tomorrow I will try the entire route from Flamingo to Cheyenne .
Pretty good !|&|They have many vegan options if you ask !|&|Waitstaff is friendly .|&|My friend ordered the chicken marsala , but said there was too much fat on it .|&|I ordered the garlic noodle dish , minus the shrimp .|&|Even the half-order at $ 5 was too generous a helping , but sooo very good .|&|There were approximately 15 other people at our table , as it was a friend 's birthday dinner , and everything looked phenomenal , really .|&|I 'd definitely like to go back often if I was n't so distant from chandler !
Service was slow .|&|Sauce was good .|&|For an Italian place not bad would eat there again .|&|Portions are huge .|&|Especially the lunch portions .
This place great for kids of all ages .|&|They have a skate park , trampoline , snack bar , and many other activities .|&|Have a birthday and party events here .
Good service .|&|Came here as I 'm waiting for my dog to get released from the vet .|&|Cold beers relaxing atmosphere .|&|Only second time would come again if I 'm in the area for.some Mexican .
Good service .|&|Good portions .|&|Liked the Wisconsin cheese curds .|&|Beer was cold .|&|Ribs were tender and the shrimp was good .
We 've been going here for years , but only about once per year because , though the food is very good and of high quality , it is expensive .|&|We recently ordered 3 entrees , soft drinks and no dessert , and the bill was $ 85 with tip .|&|But for that price you get a lot of food , great banchan .|&|The bulgogi is some of the best I 've tried in town .|&|All the dishes are authentic .|&|The owner made a nice gesture by coming to the table to ask if everything was ok .|&|If you want to splurge a bit for top notch Korean food then Mother 's hits the spot .
I 'm reviewing the roast pork sandwich .|&|Great bread , tasty and moist pork , sharp provalone and broccoli rabe make for a delicious combo .|&|I only wish I had ordered the 10 inch rather than the 6 inch .|&|Definitely would get that again and wan na try the numerous other sandwiches available .
Total hole in the wall .|&|I 'm always the only white boy in the place .|&|But you know it 's good as many Mexicanos with their whole families arrive here regularly .|&|Huge menu .|&|The Hispanic guys at my place of work will vouch for the excellent consome loco , a fresh homemade chicken and rice soup served with avocado - hits the spot during cooler seasons .|&|Normally they hate all mexican places in town but they like this one , so that 's all you need to know .
The German pancake is the bomb , better than the regular American pancakes which were still good , fluffy and soaked up the syrup wonderfully .|&|I like the small touches of serving warm syrup and the powdered sugar with lemon to make a glaze on the German pancake .|&|Omelette was huge .|&|Enjoyable and reasonable prices .|&|We will be back !
The food is quite good .|&|Everything we tried was tasty .|&|The problem is the price .|&|I kid you not : $ 5.00 for a side of white rice , $ 5.00 for a coke ( no refills ) .|&|Por la chingada !|&|Best value is probably the chilaquiles - they are great and really fill you up .|&|If someone else is paying ... do n't miss it .
You 're not get any ambiance , hipster vibes or VIP service .|&|What you will get is tasty milk tea and fruit smoothies that I 'd rather get here than make the drive to Spring Mountain .|&|Tried the taro milk tea , Thai tea and banana-strawberry smoothie and all were great .|&|We be back to get those again and try others on their big menu .
Great banh mi sandwich with egg and pork loaf .|&|My half-vietnamese wife said the bun bo hue was the best she had in Vegas - spicy and has chicken skin , funky meat parts that she loves but Americans might not go for .|&|The broken rice dish was not up to par ( except for the egg meatloaf which was the best I 've had in Vegas ) so I would skip that but the rest of the items are tasty .|&|Lots of Vietnamese people eating here so you know they are keeping it real .
If you 're a local , it 's a drag to have to go to the strip for Chicago deep dish pizza .|&|The parking at Bally 's is a bear though still free for now with a Nevada license plate .|&|The self park to restaurant hike is a pain .|&|It 's worth the trip though to get the real deal , but that includes the real wait time .|&|For us on the second visit it was a solid 50 minutes for the pizza to arrive .|&|The couple next to us looked like they were really suffering with an empty table for so long .|&|Hint : eat your salad or appetizer very sloooowly ... Also note that if you eat in the main indoor dining room it is very loud .|&|There is no place for sounds to be absorbed given the concrete floors , absence of window treatments , etc .|&|But those things aside , the pizza is heavenly , with an excellent crust that you can happily finish off even if there is no sauce on it .|&|Flakey , buttery goodness .|&|Servers have been friendly , helpful and brought refills of soda without being asked .|&|The kids dig it so we will be back a lot .
So many ramen restaurants in town and they all do a good job so it 's tough to tell them apart .|&|Jinya has good appetizers and fine selection of ramen bowls .|&|They also have a couple good rice bowls if you 're not in the mood for soup .|&|The place is popular and crowded on weekends so you often have to sit at the communal table .|&|Also no seats available when waiting for a table .|&|It has fairly loud music so more appealing to hipster vibe than intimate setting .|&|Jinya is a bit more pricey than other ramen spots .
Wonderful ambience sitting outside .|&|A date should be sufficiently impressed with that .|&|The food is uniformly high quality .|&|Do n't miss the ceviche for appetizer , perhaps the tastiest item I tried .|&|Hummus ?|&|Thumbs up ! .|&|Same for the burger entree .|&|Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their choices .|&|Seems you can not go wrong here .|&|We had no issues with the service at all .
Been to Fogo de Chao ( the standard ) , Texas de Brazil and now Via Brazil .|&|So comparing Via to Fogo : Salad bar - Fogo 's is bigger but the quality is same .|&|Rice better at Via .|&|Caipirhina - Via wins for smoothness of this classic drink from Brazil .|&|Cheese bread - Fogo gets the nod for lighter and fluffier dough .|&|Meat - tie .|&|You will prefer some cuts at one locale over another but it 's a wash in the end Side dishes - Fogo wins here .|&|Via has no fried polenta and their fried bananas pale in comparison to the maduros at Fogo .|&|Desserts - too full , could n't eat any at Via .|&|Bottom line : Fogo is still the standard but you will not be disappointed by Via and I would n't hesitate to go to Via again .|&|Luv that Brazilian churrascaria .
You owe it to yourself to give this AYCE sushi joint a try .|&|It has the most generous pieces of fish that I have encountered .|&|Best fish to rice ratio for nigiri by far .|&|Super friendly service , fresh fish and lower price .|&|Ambience could use some help but the AYCE is a great deal .
First visit , tried the Soooo Cal dog , which was tasty , but you need a mouth the size of a basking shark to get it down , it is so piled high with fried onions .|&|Thumbs up for the dog , the gourmet bun and the fries .|&|Lots of interesting choices on the menu and looking forward to trying some more .
Pleasantly surprised by this Armenian owned establishment .|&|Price is right at $ 8.99 for ground beef kabobs that were super juicy and falvorful .|&|The pita chips were a big hit with hummus - totally addicting .|&|The piping hot pita bread was also great .|&|Not much ambience with the market right next to the seating , and it would be nice to have ice available for the drinks .|&|Other than that , a fine place for a quick , cheap and high quality meal .
My wife is Thai and cooks amazing Thai food at home .|&|This is basically the only Thai restaurant that she is willing to go to , even though there are several options that are closer .|&|That might be all you need to know .|&|Huge menu with an entire page dedicated to Northern Thai Isaan food .|&|Very spicy .|&|Prices are a bit steep but portions are big .|&|For four people , price came out to $ 85 with tip , no dessert .
A few things to know about this filipino gastropub : Service is friendly and attentive .|&|Rice dishes are much large than expected .|&|Generous portions .|&|The baby back ribs are a hit .|&|Ca n't miss with those .|&|The special lechon is an interesting dish with crispy pork rind and fatty pork belly around paella style rice .|&|Good but not a repeat dish for me .|&|Plantains , lumianitas eggrolls are tasty and popular with the kids .|&|Overall an enjoyable meal , as long as you know it 's time to throw the diet out the window for the night , since filipino food is not the healthiest around .
There 's been a proliferation of korean bbq joints in town but we keep going back to the old school places like Tofu Hut .|&|Been going here for 5+ years .|&|At times the service is a bit wanting but overall they have a decent KBBQ at a good price .|&|It 's no frills and no try-to-be- cool Top 40 crummy music blasting incessantly .|&|The salad is tasty .|&|Some of the other places have better cuts of meat but you will pay for it .
Korean BBQ on Spring Mtn Rd + weekend night = long wait times .|&|Rather than endure 40 minutes at our usual spots , we tried Magal where there was no wait at 7PM on a Saturday .|&|It 's spacious and has the usual trendy industrial decor with non-stop K-pop .|&|Important to know : No AYCE and No bulgolgi !|&|If you order the meat combo then you will witness a very well rehearsed cooking display at your table .|&|Meats are high quality , juicy ; melt in your mouth for some cuts .|&|Where they missed the mark was the banchan .|&|It was a strange array of items with the only familiar one being kimchi .|&|We did n't care for the onions in sauce and a bizarre cilantro salad .|&|No fish cake , sprouts , cucumber or veggie pancake .|&|Will return but maybe only when the wait is too long elsewhere .|&|Hope that banchan will improve .
Decent boba tea though not as good as others I have tried and reviewed in Vegas .|&|Both the Hokkaido milk tea and taro slushy do n't quite reach the gold standard .|&|Friendly service .|&|Location is a bit dicey with panhandler firmly planted outside the door .|&|Too bad I will have to drive a lot further to get the cream of the crop .
I 'm from Chile so i know this type of cuisine quite well and i can say that this is food is authentic and the restaurant is definitely worth a visit .|&|Some may be put off however by the rather mediocre decor , but if you do n't mind that , then you will enjoy great empanadas - best cheese one in town - and the mixed bbq that is cooked at your table that most people order : a carnivore 's dream , lots of food .|&|The blood sausage is not as good as I 've had in S. America but overall this is a nice restaurant and I 'm glad the option exists in Vegas .
On the plus side , this is authentic Vietnamese food .|&|The place is packed with Vietnamese so you can bet that you are getting the real deal .|&|Having visited Hanoi , I can attest to how the pho is nearly identical to what I sampled in the homeland .|&|On the negative side , you do n't go here for the ambience or the cleanliness .|&|Do n't expect to be pampered by the service and it might get pretty smokey in there from all of the tabletop bbq going on .|&|If you prioritize the authenticity and quality of the food over all else then you wo n't be disappointed .
Fresh sushi with some unique uni dishes worth trying .|&|Brussels sprouts starter was a hit .|&|On two separate visits , the food was consistently good and service attentive .|&|One area where they could improve is on the nigiri sushi with uni .|&|The portions were miniscule - very small base of rice and nori - compared to what you would expect of typical sushi restaurants .|&|Otherwise , this a nice local spot for a splurge .
Hard to imagine that you ca n't find something you like at The Sandwich Spot , with all of the specialty sandwiches and a myriad of bread combinations + the extras .|&|Takes longer to prepare but it 's worth it .|&|With the Spot in my hood , have n't visited the massive chain sub way joints for many moons .
Well done , basic breakfast place .|&|Very good buttery hashbrowns and fluffy pancakes .|&|Prices are a bit high but portions are generous .|&|Would have given 5 stars but a glass of apple juice ( from a bottle ) is $ 2.80 !|&|Insane .|&|Nearly 6 bucks for 2 apple juices .|&|You have been warned .
Tiny place in the Greenland food court .|&|Decent bibimbop that was a tad skimpy on the meat but overall satisfying especially with the hot sauce and I added kimchi that took it up a notch .|&|The bulgogi serving was huge , and pollack soup had a nice mild flavor .|&|Banchan consisted of only kinchi , pickled radish and sprouts , so they could do better there , but overall a good meal in the cafeteria .|&|Family was happy with everything .
They just changed the name to Bowlology but it 's the same inside .|&|Delicious Acai bowl called Berry Good bowl is a winner , but of course it ai n't cheap .
Not sure why this place gets some crummy reviews .|&|Every time we 've been here , it 's been very good .|&|The pho is great , and i know since I 've tasted the real thing in Hanoi .|&|The rice dishes are also tasty , especially the grilled pork .|&|Their menu is typical for viet places in the US , lots of choices for pho and noodle bowls , yummy smoothies .|&|Staff is usually friendly and attentive .|&|I think its better than pho kim long , though the latter is not bad .
Clean and comfortable .|&|Eat before you come though as a popcorn with drink can be almost many !|&|Nice staff though .
I love the building -- what a great urban gem off the main road of 65 in a cute river town .|&|Large enough to accommodate group meetings without being too noisy .|&|Yet intimate .|&|They have a nice bar area that is traditional in Italian espresso cafes I had the chili while I was there and I was very impressed -- mildy spicy , hearty , and warming .|&|I ca n't wait to go back to try their coffee and other treats .
If you are in the mood for stick to your ribs food , you know the kind that has grease through the bun ?|&|This is it then .|&|The food is hot , and the price is reasonable .|&|Generally , I must be REALLY craving something like this , but overall I would recommend it for those moments that we are n't worrying about our arteries
I have have to disagree with the below poster .|&|I was turned onto Mad Mex during my college years because the opportunity to eat out at half price was worth it .|&|Furthermore , their veg .|&|friendly menu was satisfying and NEW at that time ( tofu in a dish ...|&|WHAT ? ) .|&|So I have continued to deal with lousy service and horribly lighting for my tofu burritos = )
I wish I could describe my love for this place .|&|If you are looking for a fast , inexpensive , and homemade lunch in Pittsburgh , look at this place .|&|I 've been here several times .|&|The hummus is out-of-this-world creamy , the falafel is fresh and hot , everything is flavored nicely .|&|I love that the family seems to be working together .|&|The guy that owns it and works the register always seems so happy .|&|I love coming here to eat !
I belong to this gym ...|&|I live in the South section of Pittsburgh , and I find that this gym is not too far from me .|&|The staff is friendly , the equipment is quite good .|&|You get two free personal training sessions when you join .|&|They have lots of weights ( which my boyfriend uses ) and a decent cardio room .|&|The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment .|&|Water is only $ 1 a bottle !
Well the South Side Riverfront Park is similar ... .|&|I park under the bridge , and I find that if I go early enough ( 7:00 am ) there are n't too many boats parked near the dock .|&|I used to bike with my dog down here but had to stop because other dog owners feel the need to allow off-leash playtime in public .|&|Thus a few crashes .|&|The South Side trail extends from 10th Avenue all the way down Carson Street to 885 .|&|Its about 5 miles long , which allows for a nice bike ride .|&|Sort of urban , sort of rural ( i.e. , trees ) .|&|Nice in summer .|&|They salt most of it in the winter for the runners .
So I stumbled into this Giant Eagle Market District on my way home from Trader Joe 's .|&|( Note : The only grumble I have with TJ is lack of everyday essentials and I was suprised to learn that TJ does n't stock dry beans ) .|&|So I am headstrong about making lentil soup that day and instead of going to Whole Foods ( see past review ) .|&|I have been to the South Hills GE Market District before .|&|I actually enjoy the experience of walking around HUGE stores that overwhelm me with variety and random things .|&|Thus is the experience of GE Market District .|&|You are in a full-service grocery store that caters to all income levels .|&|AND you get FUEL POINTS for wasabi-covered soy beans .|&|Fantastic !|&|They give you a map of the store , which is truly needed , because the variety and stock is endless .|&|The parking at the Shadyside GE is sort of hectic .|&|Making a left out of the parking lot is pretty difficult .|&|I enjoy these new Giant Eagle grocery-monopoly attempts .
I like the Quiet Storm because it offers food as well as drinks .|&|The spinach artichoke dip and white pita pizza is good .|&|I never had a Chai Milkshake until I went to the quiet storm .|&|If you can deal with East End `` urbanites '' then I would suggest trying it out , if nothing for a good laugh and decent food .
Okay -- here I am nearly 5 years later back in the city .|&|I used to love this place and it has grown pretty well .|&|I like their vegan menu .|&|I like their beer .|&|The wait staff could be a bit more attentive , but overall I really like it there .
I like this place .|&|When I was looking to move to Mt .|&|Washington , I certainly did my research on coffee shops because I wanted one within walking distance .|&|Shiloh Street is interesting to me because I like the mix of Grandview tourists and residents .|&|My first stop at the coffee shop was nice .|&|The owner is approachable and courteous .|&|The coffee is good which is important .|&|Not certain which roaster they use , but they have good hours and open at 7:00 AM .|&|There is seating outside .|&|My only complaint is the lack of a website .|&|I would n't even mind just a basic website with a menu updated seasonally to reflect any drink specials .|&|This seems to be a common thread with some of the businesses along Shiloh Street which is one of the core business areas in Mt .|&|Washington .|&|Perhaps I will offer my pro-bono help with it ?
I have n't been on Yelp in some time but I felt compelled to come back on here to do this review .|&|I have been here once a week since they have opened and have been really happy each time .|&|Maybe it 's the mood boost from all the vitamins being absorbed into my blood stream , who knows .|&|First off , thank goodness for Eat N Park and their corporate capital to bring a much-needed juicery into downtown Pittsburgh .|&|I think it 's great .|&|I hope they do well .|&|The manager of the store and the employees are still going through their learning curve but I do n't think it 's unreasonable to expect that to last ( per Justine 's review ) .|&|They are less than a month old .|&|I 've had the acai bowl as she spoke of and it was sweet -- it 's fruit based .|&|I guess I was not `` shoked '' by this ...|&|It was n't sweet like saccrine ( ha !|&|) , or sweet from added sugar , but sweet from the fruit going into it .|&|They list each ingredient that goes into the smoothie , juice , or bowl .|&|I appreciated that .|&|I 've tried their vegan protein and I was okay -- it 's plant based and not as forumlated as others .|&|It was n't overly chalky .|&|I 've had the green juice and I love it .|&|They do n't serve it super foamy like other places which I appreciate because I hate getting a cup of juice with 1/3 of it being foam .|&|Not cool .|&|The only thing I would complain about it the price-to-juice ratio .|&|At the other juice bars around town you get a larger size juice/smoothie for the same price that you spend at Delicious Raw .|&|I do n't think this will distract me from buying here because when I want a juice downtown , I 'm happy to even have an option .|&|Staff is friendly , menu has options , in general I like this place .|&|If they could figure out a way to make the pricing more competitive I think they will grow more followers .
Kind of greasy , but it 's a unique diner style restaurant .|&|I enjoy it for fish sandwiches and mac n cheese .
I live on Mt .|&|Washington , so this place is convenient via incline to try something other than Redbeard 's .|&|The happy hour specials are decent and the app 's are tasty and diverse .|&|My biggest complaint are the wait staff both in the bar area and the dining area .|&|They are just not attentive .|&|If you get to the happy hour at 6 and expect to have two drinks , guess again .|&|They will take your drink order at 6:15 , meal order at 6:30 , deliver your drinks at 6:20 and return with your food only in time for 7:05 to see if you need a refill .|&|Ask before the specials end .|&|Otherwise , this is a nice change of pace .|&|From my prior review , the drinks are still pricey
I live close to the Shiloh and I think I will become more of a fan as they work out some of the kinks .|&|So far the food has been enjoyable ( buffalo chicken dip ?|&|yes , please ) as well as the atmosphere .|&|Having gone to their sister restaurant in Shadyside , I was really happy to see the Shiloh open again .|&|My only complaint is one which will be ironed out in time : the wait staff is still trying to adjust .|&|For example , the waitress we had when we ate there took quite some time to come back to us to refill beers and waters .|&|It was n't busy so I was a little upset about that .|&|When I went for drinks one night , they only had one bartender and a barback that was not old enough to back-up the bartender when they got busy .
Several years ago I decided to stop at this cute little grocery store in the South Hills called McGinnis Sisters .|&|Little did I know this store would help me find great quality cuts of meat ( try the bacon from the meat counter when they have it !|&|) , fresh breads , artisan cheeses , great quality coffee .|&|I was smitten .|&|It was through this store I developed my love of cooking .|&|Time ( and work ) took me away from Pittsburgh for a few years but now I am back .|&|A lot can be said about the Whole Paycheck stores popping up around Pittsburgh as well as the butchers in the East End ( I will never go there ) that have become trendy since I 've left .|&|I 'm just not interested in going to these stores as I like my `` tried and trusted '' stores in Pittsburgh .|&|McGinnis Sisters is one of them .|&|I recently visited my trusted store and had a sub-par experience with a cut of pork .|&|I was n't sure what to do , honestly , as I never expected to have this experience ...|&|I emailed them to let them know of a wonky butcher experience ( his description of the product was less than steller ) as well as my cut of pork shoulder .|&|Wow .|&|I could not be more impressed with their customer service and dedication to their product .|&|They are n't just selling product , they BELIEVE in their product .|&|They offered to replace the pork shoulder and to work with their Meat Department manager to make it right .|&|When I returned to the store , the wonky butcher was there ( this time he coughed into his glove and I 'm pretty sure he did n't change it ) but the other guys behind the counter were SO QUICK to help me .|&|I brought in the leftover pork and they replaced it , no questions asked .|&|I really do love McGinnis Sister 's and try to talk them up whenever possible .|&|I love that they carry milk from Brunton Dairy .|&|I love their fresh bread ( I got both on this second trip ) and their seafood is still as fresh as I remember .|&|My second go-round with my pork was phenomenal .|&|Thank you all for a great experience !
The most helpful staff of all of the TJs in the city -- by far .|&|I 'm not sure if it 's because it 's so new , but I 've been there three times now and two out of the three times the staff has been helpful .|&|The first time , they were out of single-limes .|&|The staff went in the back and did n't have any and gave me one from the bag and gave me one .|&|The second time was through the chit-chat at the checkout .|&|I learned you can freeze their ready-to-make pizza crusts which I had asked before at the East Liberty store and the staff did n't know .|&|The like how spacious it is .|&|Much better than East Liberty .|&|Their product selection in what I call the `` normal foods '' ( i.e. , dried pasta , spices , sauces ) does leave a little to be desired , though .|&|Hopefully they expand that .
If West Liberty Avenue became more developed , I think this place would stay around .|&|Very good food and service .|&|Good beer
Honestly the best pizza in the south hills that is n't Mineo 's .|&|Fresh , hot , pizza .|&|Generous toppings .|&|Friendly staff .|&|Seating inside for folks that want to take their kids .|&|The only problem is that the wait time was n't very accurate which was odd since I had gone on a Sunday night .
Solid Italian hoagie .|&|I would recommend asking for light onion if you are n't a fan .|&|A half will definitely feed two people .|&|Really fast pick-up times even on what appeared to be a pretty busy night .|&|Hidden gem would be the pizza bagels !
I would rather get a coffee from here than across the street at Starbucks but they could definately update their menu with more natural items like smoothies and juices .|&|Coffee is n't that good but it is better than Starbucks .|&|I like that they are a Pittsburgh institution and I generally go here on Saturday mornings which I do n't think is the typical angsty-teenager time .
I like Redbeards .|&|The patio is nice and provides a fun ambiance for Shiloh Street ...|&|Happy Hour specials are good .|&|I 've had their mozzarella sticks which are massive but good .|&|I have n't gone here on a weekend night .|&|Bartenders are nice and so are the waitresses .|&|Only downfall : they need a website .
Okay , so I definitely consider Club Cycle to be the `` original '' 100 % spin studio of the South Hills .|&|Who knew there would be so many options for indoor cycling in the South Hills ?|&|It 's been cool to watch them grow from a small studio in Dormont ( when my Cousin first started going & was obsessed & recommended I try ) , to a larger space in Castle Shannon , to a second studio in Beaver County .|&|I -WISH- they were in Beaver when I lived there , because I had to drive all the way to Cranberry !|&|I 've taken part in their 90 minute classes , their 45 minute classes , and their 60 minute classes .|&|I 've had three different instructors including the owner .|&|LOVE taking the owners class .|&|I did feel called-out when another instructor said folks that go over on RPMs are n't working hard enough ( my suggestion would be to coach differently and say `` hey , just a reminder to the class to stay within this RPM range '' ... heck , there could be some strong cyclists in the class as well ! ) .|&|The atmosphere is very club-like and the DJ and videos make the class fly by .|&|I really enjoy that because it can feel monotonous after awhile ( it is a stationary bike afterall ! )|&|Honestly , what sealed the deal ( and if it were n't for the aggressive coaching style they would get 5 stars but I feel like that 's really important ) was the customer service !|&|I bought a new pair of cycling shoes there ( my old ones bit the dust after 10 years ) and I noticed they had a crack in them three days after I got them !|&|The bearded guy at the front desk was SO nice and replaced them with a better pair , no questions asked .|&|I could not have been happier until he gave me a free wrench for future clip adjustment !|&|Ahh !|&|Perfect .|&|Honestly , I was blown away .|&|I think those of us that are avid cyclists know how annoying it is when a clip comes loose and to have that to keep in my gym bag is perfect !|&|A+ on that for sure .|&|Finally , I think the culture of this place is really important .|&|I do n't feel the need to wear high-end athletic wear to fit in unlike some other gyms and the instructors do n't come around and add resistance ( yes , that 's happened to me and yes I never went back ) .|&|All in all , a very positive experience here !
I am trying to find a good place in the south hills to get waxed .|&|After a very ( very ) bad groupon experience , I decided to try the place down the road .|&|Total bonus : they offered 50 % off the service the first time ( and you leave with samples as a new client ! ) .|&|The good : it really was NOT as painful as my last skin-wrenching experience ( see other review ) .|&|The woman applying the wax was very thorough with hair removal .|&|Their `` system '' is to apply wax in two areas , work on one while the other cures , which is supposed to save time .|&|The woman who did my wax was very personable , but I think you need to be to do those types of services .|&|Waxing itself was very positive .|&|It was relatively fast .|&|The only thing I would complain about is the amount of residue left after the wax , which felt excessive .|&|I definitely think some more time could have been spent cleaning up but I will give them a pass since it was a discounted service .|&|The cool thing about this place is they have a pretty nice discounted `` subscription '' service that I may take advantage of if I do n't find my 5-star waxing salon soon .
I like this place .|&|They have fat free frozen yogurt in pistachio which is amazing .
I am thrilled there is a six-pack shop in Mt .|&|Washington .|&|I finally stopped in one night in the mood for a seasonal beer and I knew P & D would n't disappoint .|&|I 've heard from others they are pricey , but I guess that is what is expected from a place that sells craft beer .|&|I was really pleased with their selection .|&|Most of the bottles I purchased were around $ 2-3 which is expected when buying speciality beer .|&|My six pack ended up around $ 14 .|&|I do n't understand the complaints about the price , really .|&|Next door at Redbeards you can buy $ 2.50 drafts ?|&|For the same price , I can get better quality and more selection of beer .|&|Sure , there are beers for $ 7/bottle , but I 'm pleased to find cherry wheat for the same price .|&|Have n't tried the food , but I did notice it 's all dog themed , which is novel , but kind of cute .|&|It 's set up kind of neat , with outdoor and bar seating .|&|I will be back .
This is a great experience holistically .|&|Have your car valeted .|&|It 's only $ 4 .|&|Very affordable .|&|The elevator up to the Grotto gives you a great view of the city .|&|When you make your reservations , you need to ask for `` view seating '' but outside of that , getting a reservation is seamless .|&|You can reserve online through their website .|&|I went with a mentor/colleague to `` celebrate '' a job termination ( do n't ask ) and we had the whole experience .|&|Our waitress was very nice and tentative .|&|One of the managers , who is a wine afficianto , helped us pick out a good wine on the moderately priced side .|&|The wine was fantastic .|&|We ordered steamed clams as an appetizer and -oh so good- with their hot bread to dip in the sauce .|&|The manager learned I lost my job and brought us a `` chocolate cake '' drink , on the house , which was very nice .|&|House salads were fresh and a nice size portyion .|&|I ordered the mahi mahi and it was fantastic .|&|Nice size portion , fresh .|&|Only complaint was that the lemon wedge was too small to put over the fish ...|&|Finally , the dessert ...|&|I had the white chocolate macadamia mousse .|&|To .|&|die .|&|for .|&|Certainly the restaurant is pricey , but the food quality was good , the atmosphere is nice , and the staff are very friendly .|&|This is a good special occasion restaurant .
$ 6 .|&|Three huge tacos .|&|One was pulled chicken which was noting to write home about .|&|I topped it with one of the really spicy sauces which had my nose running .|&|The sauce was awesome .|&|One was pulled pork .|&|Wow .|&|To die for .|&|So good .|&|I topped that with a milder sauce ( I ca n't remember which one ) .|&|The pork was tender and cooked to perfection .|&|Plus the corn tortillas .|&|So fresh .|&|Squeezed some lime on top .|&|Fantastic .|&|One was chorizo .|&|It was a little heavier than I would have preferred ( i.e. , greasy ) but I guess I kind-of asked for it .|&|I topped that with the avocado sauce .|&|It helped cool the spicy chorizo ( and my still burning mouth ) .|&|Added more lime .|&|I would like to buy a chorizo and make it with eggs the next morning .|&|Friendly staff .|&|Quick service -- they fry the tortillas right in front of you .|&|The corn tortillas are awesome too .|&|You dress your tacos yourself .
What a great little place .|&|I love that it 's located in Millvale as opposed to another `` hip '' Pittsburgh neighborhood .|&|I stopped in one day about 20 minutes before they were scheduled to close and I did n't feel pressured to leave or hurry .|&|It 's quite a bit to take in -- beautifully decorated confections in two cases .|&|Between the fondant penguins ( which I held back on ) and the macaroons , there were important decisions to be made .|&|I got a dozen macaroons in various flavors .|&|Pistachio and salted caramel are spot on .|&|Soft yet crisp .|&|Light but dense .|&|Fresh .|&|This is definitely what a `` treat '' should be .|&|Jean Marc also gave me a chocolate truffle .|&|Oh boy .|&|It was good .|&|Dark chocolate .
I want to give this place five stars , and I would if some items were cleaned up .|&|I 'll get to that later .|&|Regardless , I really liked this place during my Friday lunch visit .|&|I liked the menu .|&|It was similar to a more hipster place on Shiloh , with a nice selection of burgers , wings , and other `` better '' munchies .|&|They also had Lenten specials .|&|Lots of different draft beers and tons of bottles from what I could see .|&|The bartender was n't overly friendly ( Problem # 1 ... he seemed not too happy to be at work which is a definite turn off . )|&|I ordered a crab sake sandwich , given it was Friday in Lent and it was a staple on their menu I wanted to see what they were workin ' with .|&|I think the crab cake is the `` end all be all '' of a restaurant -- if it is fresh you know the food is good .|&|If it is a dense puck of breading then you know what the restaurant is like .|&|It was phenomial .|&|I got the sweet potato fries which were just so-so ( it 's hard to find good SP fries , IMO ) .|&|The bread that it was served on was SO FRESH that I had a hard time not picking at my pieces .|&|The portions were reasonable and you could tell the main dish was the star of the show because they side portions were perfect .|&|Sitting at the bar was the classic Mt Washington crowd -- the obnoxious frat guys , the mt washington natives , young professionals .|&|I really liked this atmosphere but Problem # 2 is that the obnoxious frat guys kind of turned the environment .|&|I mean , there is no need to state loudly ( for all the bar to hear , at noon-or any time of the day ) `` Worthless Yinzers '' during a conversation with your buddy .|&|I mean , you really are n't impressing anyone .|&|The draft beers are expensive to my no-longer-a-city-dweller perspective , with two beers and a sandwich costing a little over $ 20 , but I would go back again for the food .|&|It was awesome .
I agree with the below poster .|&|I like Giant Eagle because they have everything someone needs .|&|They accept double coupons , have fuel perks , and are just the local grocery chain .|&|Sometimes a store is hit or miss depending upon the location , but I am satisfied with Giant Eagle and will do my grocery shopping there .
My husband and I have eaten here multiple times and I 've taken several friends here for lunch .|&|It 's been excellent every time and the service is always friendly and informative .|&|I guess it 's not perfect judging from some other reviews , but you just ca n't please everyone every time .|&|It 's great neighborhood spot .
I had the Spicy Mochiko with brown rice , steamed vegetables with a side of wasabi ranch .|&|Good twist on modern chicken tenders and bites .|&|I highly recommend getting the lychee lemonade , to die for .
Just brought my pup Roi to get neutered .|&|The staff was pretty good , they treated my dog with care and I think they did everything pretty quickly , drop off at 7:30am and pick up at 3:00 .|&|They did kinda try to upsell a bunch of stuff that kinda sounds like your dog is going to die if you do n't but that 's just the way it goes now-a-days .|&|The Vet himself was kinda dry and a little short with words , but I did n't have many questions , the vet techs were very friendly and informative .|&|My cat is due for a checkup soon so I may be using their services again shortly , because I was please with my visit , and Roi has been doing great since the surgery , healed quickly and never winced in pain .
Great place , good donuts , I 'm not even a donut person .|&|This place is right across the street from us so it is really convenient for us to get a quick breakfast and some coffee .|&|I usually get the Cinnamon roll cause its the size of a Frisbee and dunk it in coffee .|&|They have a pretty good selection of donuts and coffee , really beats the hell out of krispy kreme .
Had about an hour and a half to kill before my next flight .|&|We stoped in here for lunch and got a nice juicy burger , it was really good .|&|Also got their Octoberfest beer and it was pretty good too .|&|Only thing I would change is that for the price I could have used some more french fries with the meal and the bun on the burger just seemed kinda like the cheep frozen kind , and a little small for the burger , but I enjoyed my meal and watching football on the screens and even got a pint glass with their logo to take home .
I 'm not a big fan a big chain restaurants , but I can always count on Chili 's .|&|When my wife and I were dating , we would usually go here once a week for chips and salsa and buffalo wings and a couple of drinks .|&|Now that we are married , it is still a good place to go if your looking for some quick decent food .
Everyone already knows how good Chipotle is , but this location has always given us good service , they are pretty speedy .|&|They screwed up on on line order we placed once , and they fixed it right away and gave a free drink and extra chips , really cool we were n't even mad .
We hit this place up frequently because it 's just around the corner from us so it 's on our quick dinners list .|&|Basic fast food stuff , a little better than most chains , and quick
Great place to see a small , intimate show .|&|I have seen many acts there and then watch them move on to bigger venues and all I can think about is how I wish they were playing at the Marquee .|&|It 's got great sound and pretty much anywhere is a great view .|&|But other than that , its nothing too special , just future event posters stapled everywhere and expensive drinks .
This place just has a really good happy hour .|&|I usually just stick to appetizers when I go but with free chips and salsa all night , I do n't need much more .|&|Their happy hour goes from 3:00 to 7:30 , fantastic considering happy hours seem to be ending earlier and earlier now a days .|&|There are plenty of HDTV 's around to keep me entertained , so I 'm gon na guess it gets really busy on Sundays during football .|&|This is just a good place for pretty cheap drinks and decent Mexican food .
Just ate here today for lunch , not too bad $ 5.50 for two slices and a drink .|&|The pizza was very good , good taste and the crust was really crispy but did n't cut the roof of your mouth , I like that .|&|The place was also really clean , not too large but most people just grab and go .|&|The staff was also very friendly and made sure to say hi and thank them for coming in to everybody .
I do n't care much for their menu , but the carne asada ( steak ) quesadilla I ended up ordering was HUGE and very tasty !|&|The waitress was attentive .|&|The leftovers were great .|&|Oh , and parking here was surprisingly easy in their lot ( no need to go to the overflow across the street ) .|&|However , I will never go back here as the music was turned up to a deafening level and was blasting some type of screaming-as-lyrics type noise `` music '' that was painful .|&|The restaurant was also packed , so people were yelling OVER the yelling `` music '' which made me want to just leave , which I would have if I was n't with my mother ( who thankfully is getting a little hard of hearing and so was saved from some of the horrendous experience ) .|&|I feel a weekend lunch is supposed to be a relaxing affair , and not feel like a night club !|&|If this was management-approved music , and not some employee 's iPod plugged in to the sound system , I disagree with their `` mood/environment '' choice and will just have to stick with Federal Pizza next door .
I hate dollar stores .|&|My ideal neighborhood world not include any ( or title loan stores , or Goodwill , but I digress ) .|&|I freely admit I like more upscale places to shop .|&|I also have a feeling that the store 's presence ( along with the numerous ugly For Lease banners in the Palo Verde strip center ) is preventing the neighborhood from gentrifying as fast as it should be .|&|However , even if your product and clientele are n't upscale , you still NEVER have an excuse to be foul mouthed .|&|The sketchy looking male cashier needs to work in the stock room away from customers if he 's going to drop swear words constantly .|&|Especially when the customers behind me includes young children !|&|Yes , the two women he helped before me bought a disgusting amount of product ( I 've never seen someone blow $ 100 at a dollar store ) , but you need to at least use substitution words when you 're venting .|&|Why did I come here in the first place ?|&|Well , I 've heard it was `` very clean and nice '' for a dollar store , and it was n't too bad .|&|They had a lot more merchandise than I expected , and had private label goods from Target and Kroger .|&|I picked up a pack of tissue paper for $ 1 and change , because I just could not bring myself to spend $ 3 for TWO SHEETS of `` artisan '' tissue paper at Cost Plus World Market .|&|It 's not great quality ( the colors are `` muddy '' and randomly assorted ) , but I managed to pull everything together nicely .|&|Would I go back ?|&|If I needed something low quality and cheap , like party favors , sure .|&|It 's never going to be a go-to place for me though .
Wanted to bump them up a star since the wonton soup and fried rice are not really bad and the nice lady who took my order on the phone remembered me .|&|However the soup 's broth was basically plain chicken stock , and needed soy sauce and pepper to make it tasty .|&|The fried rice had a good amount of seasoning and meat , but it was extremely greasy/oily .|&|I 've never had fried rice with this much oil !|&|A copious amount coated the interior of the white takeout container as I moved the rice into a plastic storage container .|&|The pricier version of the soup , the wor wonton , is even less desirable ... bland , overcooked veggies and meat , sadly .
Mediocre chain diner with around Denny 's quality or slightly lower food .|&|I guess the big appeal is their hours ?|&|Maybe I have been spoiled by the awesomeness that is Chase 's Diner in Chandler , but there 's really no reason for me to ever go here again .
A little sad , sparsely merchandised ( lots of empty spots on the shelves ) , and with a surprising amount of non-Japanese goods like Ziploc bags and Hunt 's tomato sauce .|&|I did find one of the small individually wrapped shiro daifuku mochi in the `` grab and go '' case , and noticed they did have Lotte mochi ice in a standing cooler by the wall coolers .|&|Overall , I was really disappointed with their offerings .|&|New Tokyo , Lee Lee , and Super L are definitely superior .|&|All three carry multipacks of mochi , though only Lee Lee and Super L have the fresh stuff .|&|Maybe their focus is on the restaurant type spot at the front of the shop now ?
Went here for lunch .|&|It took them foreeeeeeeeever to serve the food .|&|We 're talking 30 minutes to serve salads and soup when the restaurant is dead .|&|Pretty ridiculous .|&|Water glass was not kept full , and was n't refilled for a good ten minutes despite me asking the server for it pointedly .|&|Waiter got one order incorrect .|&|Brother 's steak took extremely long because the waiter said it was n't well-done .|&|Coconut shrimp were small but tasted fine .|&|Potato soup was good , not too oniony .|&|Do NOT order any grilled chicken or fish .|&|It will be extremely dry .
Went here with a friend last year .|&|We were told there would be a wait for a table , despite the fact that a perfectly set table that was situated almost directly in front of us .|&|We waited for quite a while , browsing the art and looking around the pool , and were eventfully seated ... at the EXACT same table we had been staring at earlier .|&|Are they trying to do the `` fake wait '' thing to seem more popular or raise their bar 's business ?|&|I find that very tacky .|&|Anyway , I had been craving chorizo , so I ordered the dos huevos ( 2 eggs and chorizo with corn tortillas ) .|&|It was okay .|&|Not mine blowing , and the portion was definitely really skimpy , especially for the price .|&|At least it was cooked well .|&|They did give my buddy a free dessert for his birthday , so that was nice .|&|The service was alright , but this place definitely had the feel of `` you eat here because it 's cool and thus you look cool '' and not `` you 're here because the food/service is amazing . ''|&|I 'd go back if a friend wanted to try it , but I wo n't venture here again on my volition .
I previously purchased my flooring from the Chandler/Gilbert Location .|&|It has held up well , so I can vouch for their laminate 's quality .|&|However , this location is understaffed , which seems to have led to a decline in customer service .|&|They definitely need to have more people on the sales floor , preferably equipped with excellent customer service training .
It 's `` okay '' but nowhere I would go on my own volition .|&|I 've been here twice with coworkers and the service was pretty slow both times .|&|We 've always had to have our food boxed up soon after it finally arrived .|&|I also ran into the slow refill issue that others mention .|&|The food was okay , but they 're very heavy on the sauce and cheese .|&|My chicken enchilada was decent , but did n't blow me away , despite the `` most authentic '' praise others waxed about this place .|&|I also do n't think the koi pool ( it 's not made to look like a rocky pond or anything natural ) is very sanitary , so I 'm subtracting a star for that .|&|It really should be an enclosed aquarium when it 's right in the middle of a restaurant like that .|&|I 'd go back with coworkers if this was where they wanted to go , but as for myself , I am sticking to Los Tacquitos .
It 's fine .|&|I consider it `` healthy fast food . ''|&|The cashier was friendly enough , and the seating and decor are solid fast food restaurant style .|&|I only came here to appease the appetites of someone else .|&|I would n't come back on my own accord as I do n't care for the food .
Cevapi : Greasy , crispy , savory , chewy , and a must try if you 're a bread and sausage person .|&|The bread 's crispy exterior and chewy interior ( almost like the interior of an English muffin ) are fantastic .|&|I have to stress that it 's very greasy though , so make sure you have napkins as you tear off pieces of bread to wrap the little sausages in .|&|Definitely best when it 's hot and fresh .|&|It gets more greasy and less flavorful if you let it cool for a while .|&|The small size was huge !|&|Baklava : Decent but I 've had better .|&|It 's definitely solid and not as high priced as some other places , but my piece was n't as flakey and crispy as I would like , and the layers were more dense and wet than I would prefer .|&|Tulumba : A surprisingly good donut of light cruller-like dough soaked in a simple sugar syrup and served cold .|&|I had let mine sit for a while in its to-go container so it was soaked through with watery simple syrup but still mostly chilled .|&|I did n't mind the sogginess myself .|&|There was a GIANT ( filling one of the adjoined dining rooms ) group but the waitress was able to squeeze my to-go order out without too long of a wait .|&|She also offered me a glass of water as I waited , which I appreciated .|&|The decor was a lot nicer than I was expecting too .|&|They have a selection of Milka and other international brand chocolate bars for sale at the register .|&|It 's nice to have something different from the preponderance of Mexican , Italian , Chinese , and burger places that seem to dominate this area .|&|A definite must try for bread-and-meat connoisseurs !|&|Just be warned about the greasiness .|&|I had a bit of a stomachache later in the day which may have been from this .|&|Edit : Taking the rating down a few stars because the stomach issues afterwards were awful .|&|Food poisoning from undercooked sausage perhaps ?
The little aluminum tin of flan had no caramel sauce and was $ 5 .|&|Very disappointing !
I had the meatloaf sandwich at Happy Hour and was not impressed .|&|It was actually pretty awful .|&|The games can be fun , and the outside patio `` Yard '' area was spacious .|&|I managed to pop in here when valet was n't mandatory , so I did n't have to deal with that headache .|&|I 'd give them another shot though , so I 'll probably be back some time in the future .
Tagged along with family as they dropped by here to get gingerbread cookies .|&|My sister apparently likes this place .|&|The interior of the store is quite nice ( I remember the lighting being very soft and flattering ) .|&|There is quite a bit of food merchandise ( pancake mix , candy , gift baskets ) and , weirdly , a display nook of costume jewelry and a handbag .|&|They also have very large pastry case displays filled with goodies .|&|I do think the baked goods look `` too perfect '' and mass produced though ( this was a red flag ) .|&|The cashier was pleasant .|&|While family members seemed to enjoy the treats , I found them lacking .|&|The gingerbread man ( with chocolate pants , a detail family enjoyed ) had a very dry texture and was somewhat `` dog biscuit-like '' ( very bland and crumbly ) .|&|The peppermint brownie was HALF frosting ( chocolate frosting over peppermint frosting/creme over a chocolate chip brownie ) , which attempted to distract from the fact that the brownie itself was on the dry side , but it did n't make up for the loss of brownie `` gooey-ness . ''|&|I wo n't seek this place out again , but I would veto it for lunch either .|&|We really need a high-quality bakery cafe to replace the Panera-fied and bastardized Paradise Bakery .
Lowering their star rating for having shelves full of expired , moldy mochi .|&|There is no red bean mochi , and all the peanut mochi is expired , with one package having a spiderweb-like white mole inside .|&|Some of the sesame mochi had expiration dates of 2015 !
Worst baklava ever .|&|I 've never had any this bad , not even from a mall food court place back when the Fiesta Mall still had Macy 's .|&|The bottom layer was burnt .|&|The inner layers were n't golden and crispy but white and pasty .|&|The worst part was that it has NO honey or syrup at all on the inside layers .|&|None .|&|It was just layers of dry sheets of pale white dough and chopped nuts .|&|There was a tiny token drizzle on top that the cashier girl squeezed on it before she boxed it up , and that 's it .|&|I do n't think the layers of dough were brushed with butter either .|&|It 's awful , and definitely not worth the $ 3.50 they 're charging for two small triangular pieces .|&|Costco and AJ 's both have superior product , and Costco even manages a shelf-stable baklava that is much more moist , even if not drenched in honey or syrup like some plates ( most anything would be moister than this was ) .|&|I got the calamari again and the serving size was very small for the $ 9.50 they 're charging ( I 'm pretty sure it 's much smaller than what I got last time ) .|&|It could 've used a crispier coating , and was slightly too rubbery .|&|The pita was still quite good .|&|They really need to get fabric or rubber pads for the metal feet of the chairs in the dining room as the noise against the flooring is awful .|&|I do n't think I 'll be back .|&|That truly bad baklava was so disappointing .
Tried the cookies and cream pop for $ 3 .|&|The woman at the counter unwrapped it right after I bought it so I had to eat it immediately .|&|It 's definitely more icy than creamy .|&|It also had that powdery taste you get from using cocoa powder instead of chocolate .|&|The most disappointing part was that the bar was a good 85 % plain milk chocolate with only ONE `` hunk '' of white vanilla-like cream on the lower right side .|&|I expect the cream in cookies and cream to be distributed evenly or at least to swirl or run completely down one side .|&|I was only able to get two bites of the `` complete '' cookies and cream .|&|As it was , it was only marginally better than a Healthy Choice fudge bar , so I am afraid I am not a fan .
Decent food ( had the breakfast burrito , which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy ) , great location , but some of the worst live music I 've ever heard in my life , right up there with some wedding reception noise !|&|The restaurant was full and ONE person , an employee who seemed to be the singer 's girlfriend , applauded .|&|Dead silence from everyone else .|&|For several songs .|&|It was really bad .|&|I actually had the waiter change my order to takeout , but thankfully the `` musician '' packed up soon after that .|&|The poor server apologized , and said they 're working on the noise level , but I think they need to look at the talent level instead .|&|If I hear/see that awful LOUD caterwauling they call live entertainment again when I enter here , I will immediately turn around and leave .|&|This experience was actually from my second time in the restaurant .|&|My first time I walked in I was ignored , there was no one at the hostess stand area , and there was a bored looking waitress rolling silverware and pretending I was n't looking at the menus .|&|I walked out after a bit .|&|Two strikes means I 've yet to go back , since Los Tacquitos on 16th Street and Glendale is just as close , much faster , and the women working there ( owners ? )|&|give great customer service .|&|Their quality probably is n't as high as Otro , but neither are their prices .
A few people at work were ordering from here and I figured I may as well try it again .|&|Last year I had pretty bad teriyaki chicken from here ( yes , I know it 's Japanese but coworkers erroneously said it was good ) , but chalked that up to ordering the wrong thing .|&|I noticed that they use the `` cheap '' packaged soy sauce , as opposed to REAL brewed soy sauce .|&|I did not care for the taste when drizzled on the rice .|&|The sweet and sour chicken was almost inedibly salty .|&|Definitely on the extremely high level of sodium content .|&|Texture was squishy and not crunchy/fluffy/chewy enough .|&|Decent sized portion , and the sauce was on the side .|&|At least it want bland ?|&|The orders of crab rangoon and fried won ton were both good .|&|Very little meat in the won ton , but at least the crab rangoon order was n't chock full of onion .|&|The rice was n't sticky and fresh .|&|It seemed a little old and dry .|&|I would n't recommend this place unless you really want at-or-slightly-below Panda Express level American Chinese food delivered .|&|Sadly , I 've yet to find a higher than three star Chinese restaurant in Phoenix , and east valley restaurants wo n't deliver this far !|&|Giving them the two stars for convenience of delivery along with the pretty decent won ton and rangoon .
Horrifically long wait in the drive through .|&|Was charged for the wrong order , noticed by checking the receipt .|&|Thankfully the cashier was skilled enough to re-ring the order correctly .|&|Fries had an okay amount of salt , but were unremarkable .|&|Fish had a good crunch but was also unremarkable .|&|I 'm more of a fan of battered fish as opposed to bread crumbed , and definitely am not a fan of the processed `` cafeteria '' rectangle shape .|&|Cash only is an awful policy and definitely discourages me from coming here .|&|The proliferation of homeless people around the area does not help .|&|I will not be going back .
Not a fan of the citrus that they put in with their flan and cakes .|&|My custard bun was pretty lackluster .|&|It had a strange aftertaste I could n't figure out and was not very eggy or vanilla-infused .|&|It had very little filling .|&|It could not hold up to other custard buns sold at Lee Lee or Asahi Bakery .|&|They would sell a lot more bread if they bought a slicer .|&|The cashier said many people ask them to slice the bread and I am positive they would sell more loaves .|&|The $ 6 minimum charge to use a credit card is also annoying .
The front-end museum staff were friendly enough , though there were a LOT of silent employees just standing , staring into space , and `` guarding '' the exhibits .|&|It would be much more pleasant if these employees would engage museum patrons , chatting about the displays .|&|The current exhibits of women in politics/power and building models of the Casa Grande ruins ( the biggest of which you can only see through a mirror in the next room ) were not my cup of tea .|&|This is a very tiny and sparsely curated museum , so do n't expect to spend much time here .|&|The gift shop is pretty decent , if random .|&|Parking was free at the garage next door , and there 's fantastic dining and more within walking distance in Old Town .|&|I did not pay admission as I had a Culture Pass from the Phoenix Library .
Not impressed .|&|Yes , the bread is really great , and the meats and cheeses tasted good , but I do n't like that it comes with a mandatory side salad bundled into the $ 9 ( before tax and tip ) price or that the sandwich had items on it not listed in its description ( chopped green something ) .|&|I also felt the amount of cheese and meat was a little skimpy , as it was roughly the number of slices Subway would use , as opposed to somewhere like Miracle Mile Deli .|&|The employees were friendly , but there were a LOT of `` friends '' ( of the owners and/or workers ? )|&|there who received a lot of attention ( going behind the counter , obtaining free bread slices ) .|&|I feel this makes `` normal '' paying customers feel a little neglected .|&|Like when cashiers talk to each other ( and ignore you ) when ringing you up at a store .|&|I mean , I would 've appreciated a slice of bread and you probably could 've then tried to sell me a loaf .|&|Just my two cents on socializing versus selling .|&|Parking is absolutely , ridiculously inadequate , but this is also an area I would not recommend walking in .|&|The surrounding low-income neighborhood is not a very good fit for a `` hipster '' ( every male there had facial hair , it was almost comical ) , higher-end ( compared to what 's in the immediate area , not 5 minutes north ) , trendy ( no set menu , random Italian words ) restaurant , but hopefully I am proven wrong .|&|They have potential , seeing as they are so close to the freeway and traffic on McDowell is not as bad as Indian School ( and rent is MUCH lower than Camelback ) .|&|On the other hand , the Subway and Wendy 's across the street here see MUCH less business than their locations on Camelback and Indian School .|&|Ways to improve : 1 : Print paper ( primarily for takeout ) menus .|&|The chalkboard is difficult to read , and if they continue to insist on never having a set menu they might have issues getting regular phone orders .|&|2 : Do n't accept food supply deliveries during the lunch rush !|&|3 : Unbundle the side salad from the price of the sandwiches and offer sandwiches for $ 6- $ 7 and soup or salad for an additional $ 3 .|&|4 : Offer every single customer a free sample of bread and then ask if they 'd like to buy a loaf .|&|For brownie points , offer to slice the loaf into thick or thin slices for said paying customer !|&|5 : Brand the restaurant `` Noble Bread '' and forget the Eatery sub-brand .|&|It 's splitting yelp reviews and the website redirects anyways .|&|When you have a strong brand you reinforce it ( See : Bianco renaming his `` Italian Restaurant '' to Trattoria Bianco then finally just rebadging it as another Pizzeria Bianco ) .|&|6 : Include ALL ingredients in a menu item on its written description .
Giving this place one star for carrying daifuku mochi ( adzuki bean ) , albeit the processed , boxed kind .|&|Other than that , this market was dirty , disorganized , poorly-lit , prices were poorly marked , and it was not customer-friendly in any way .|&|Zero service .|&|While the staff at other small specialty Asian markets ( not Lee Lee ) will ask if you need help , here that did n't happen .|&|There was a TINY hand-written note on the cash register stating a $ 10 minimum for credit card use .|&|Thank goodness I saw that before I looked dumb trying to use mine for a single box of mochi .|&|I wo n't be back .|&|Lee Lee carries fresh mochi , if you can catch it in stock .|&|New Tokyo has a better brand of packaged mochi ( plus frozen types ) .|&|Cost Plus is closer and much more enjoyable to shop at , and their packaged mochi is only a little worse tasting than the brand this market carries .
The customer service skills of the cashier and manager were excellent , and the lobby seemed clean at 5-something in the morning .|&|However , my egg white biscuit with cheese was a little too goopy , and my hot chocolate tasted like a heated , faintly mocha sauced , Hershey 's syrup chocolate milk .|&|It lacked any richness , and I was disappointed they do n't have peppermint syrup ( the cashier said white chocolate replaced it ) that could have helped perk it up .|&|I might have to order 2 % milk instead of skim next time .|&|On the plus side : It is NOT in one of those disgustingly tiny and hard to get in the drive through parking lots that many coffee places are in around here ( Starbucks at 16th St and Bethany Home is a prime example of that ) .
Update September 2016 : They changed their noodle soup recipe .|&|It 's now a bowl containing a super bland oil slick .|&|I 've never had my hands get super greasy from a bowl of noodle soup before !|&|Ate the noodles and wonton and then tossed it .|&|Very sad .|&|-- - Popped in here Sunday night .|&|It was pretty empty , so hopefully they 'll get busier as people figure out they are open .|&|The windows facing Bashas ' have blackout screening on them so the restaurant looks closed from the Ray road side .|&|The older Asian cashier was pleasant .|&|They were out of noodles , so I could n't try the wonton `` noodle soup . ''|&|He also said the noodles were similar to `` lo mein noodles '' when I asked if they were ramen or saimin noodles .|&|We ordered loco moco , BBQ beef ( more teriyaki than shoyu style ) , and kalbi ( Korean BBQ ) ribs .|&|The burger and BBQ beef were seasoned and cooked well , and my mom seemed to enjoy her kalbi .|&|The rice was properly cooked , though I was n't a fan of the mac salad or soggy large leafy greens under the entrees .|&|I wish they had put the loco moco over rice instead of the greens .|&|One of the eggs in my loco moco was overcooked .|&|I have two spam musubi in my fridge right now that I am hoping make for a good lunch tomorrow !|&|The misalignment of the ocean paining in the dining room annoys me ( there are visible gaps between the three sections ) , but their flatscreen tv is VERY nice .|&|All of the furniture is brand new too , and the place was very clean !|&|The three entrees plus the musubi came to around $ 35 after tax , without any drinks .|&|I 'll drop by again to see how their soup measures up to the real deal at Aloha Kitchen .
Good service , good pizza ( the spicy sausage was fantastic ) , but ridiculously loud music .|&|I 've only ever been in maybe one restaurant in my life that blasted music near this volume ( Joyride Tacos ) .|&|The music genre and selections also did not agree with me at all .|&|It was n't a relaxing experience , and while the waiter was apologetic and even lowered the music a little for me , it just was n't a good atmosphere to wind down after a stressful day at work .|&|Next time I will order my food to go .
Surly employees .|&|No spoon or napkins provided for to-go soup ( I had to ask ) .|&|Tiny tiny portion of soup for bread bowl .|&|No cookie , but choice of an apple ( ugh !|&|) , generic plain chips , or a baguette ( rock hard hunk of bread ) .|&|Cream of chicken with wild rice soup was same as always , fine , and the bread bowl was edible .|&|I miss Paradise so much and apparently everyone else does too as it was absolutely dead inside , and plastered with help wanted signs , while Fired Pie and Los Taquitos are pulling in a brisk late dinner business .
Poorly designed combination of mall and power center ( giant strip mall ) with confusing `` through streets '' in the meandering parking lot and tricky access to and from the freeway .|&|They 've had a LOT of stores close ( mostly the mall-type chain clothing stores in `` The District '' ) and several restaurants have flipped multiple times ( the Irish pub , Cadillac Ranch ) .|&|Some places are showing their age already ( Dave and Buster 's ) .|&|One time my family and I circled the entire place on a Saturday night and there was n't one single parking space open !|&|Even Chandler Fashion Center will have some spaces ( by Sears , heh ) .|&|I am NOT a fan of slapping parking in the middle of a retail center , and prefer surrounding parking garages or even the `` sea of asphalt '' that Chandler Fashion Center has ( they were going to build a garage while moving to a more upscale retail mix but that blew up with the recession ) .|&|Thankfully , the parking situation near Harkins is pretty simple .|&|I imagine Tempe Marketplace is nice for locals in the immediate neighborhoods as it gives them big box stores and the movie theater , and they 're putting an H & M in to help fix the mass exodus of apparel stores , but between superior super-regional malls ( Chandler Fashion Center closer to here for `` normal '' or Scottsdale Fashion Square for selection and luxury ) and the plethora of more convenient shopping centers closer to me , I do n't personally have a need to ever go here other than when meeting friends .
Was going to eat dinner later but wanted a snack now .|&|Decided to just try a Creme Br√ªl√©e shake .|&|The shake does n't have the crunchy `` br√ªl√©e '' pieces that Zinburger has ( nor any eggy custard-like flavor ) , and just tastes like a plain caramel shake with a squiggle of caramel sauce on top .|&|It 's still good , but not at the same level of Zinburger 's by any means , and probably slightly below SmashBurger 's Salted Caramel shake ( though it 's larger ) .|&|I wish they had the option to order a smaller size , as that much blended soft serve ( not hand-scooped ice cream ) did n't sit well with me .|&|The Rrstaurant is modern , clean , and definitely fits the Chipotle fast casual mold .|&|I would come back to try out their food , but would not come back for dessert or a treat .|&|It 's definitely a massive improvement over the always-empty Qdoba that had this space before .
Waited almost an hour for a table Sunday afternoon .|&|The restaurant is quite loud , and I found the music somewhat loud and rather grating ( it 's all top 50 female pop star music - Britney Spears and Company ) .|&|I do n't see why they do n't have seating on their patio , or why they have a ping pong table out there taking up valuable space .|&|I started with their $ 3.50 hot chocolate .|&|It was cinnamony , and the whipped cream definitely helped its richness .|&|I would have preferred it hotter and less syrupy , as it was slightly Hershey 's chocolate milk flavored .|&|With bolder flavors ( darker chocolate , more cinnamon ) and a temperature increase it would be much better .|&|I tried the breakfast pot pie which consisted of a sheet of flakey pastry topped with cream gravy ( no large sausage chunks despite what the waitress said ) that included many large chunks of undercooked carrots , and an egg sunny side up .|&|I added on a side of chicken sausage ( $ 3.75 ) which was not tasty - very bland and a little dry .|&|I should 've gotten the chorizo .|&|The hashed brown potatoes were undercooked .|&|Everything was cooling off when it was served , rather than being steaming hot .|&|The food was fine , but I did n't appreciate the multitude of undercooked carrots at all .|&|The gravy could 've used more sausage and spice/heat .|&|It was a good idea for a dish , but the components outside the egg and basic puff pastry crust did n't deliver .|&|Service was okay , though I did n't care for the waitress splitting the ticket down the middle , instead of breaking it into separate checks .|&|Parking was easy in front of Nordstrom Rack , which you can peruse while you wait for them to text you that your table is ready .|&|I 'm glad I finally got to check this place out , but I do n't see myself coming back , especially considering their prices .
Decent food , surprisingly .|&|EXTREMELY dirty place though .|&|Filthy really .|&|This former Hometown Buffet is a prime example of why you should NEVER carpet restaurants ... rice everywhere !|&|Also , am I the only one amused and confused when Chinese buffets serve Mac and cheese and similar items ?
Out of all the times I have been here , you will either love or ( dispise ? )|&|the people who work here .|&|Food is consistent but the people , uh , the people who work here either have an attitude 70 % or are pleasant 30 % .
You 'll see more sharks here than in the Pacific .|&|I only come here for the service department , there it 's shark-less .
We had a reservation there a few weeks ago and were seated right away .|&|Service was attentive -at first .|&|We got our drinks , went straight to the entr√©e .|&|After that , our server was n't very present .|&|The chicken Marsala was pretty good ; however , the pasta carbonara was very rich .|&|My friend ordered it and I felt overwhelmed after two bites .|&|Dessert was wonderful -we got the lobster tail and it was decadent .|&|Great flavor and texture .|&|The pit of night was when our waitress , Kacey , dropped the bill and told us the gratuity was already added so all we had to do was pay the total noted at the bottom .|&|The problem there was that we were a party of 3 .|&|We looked at the bill and printed directly on there was something along the lines of : '' No gratuity has been added to your bill .|&|For your convenience , here are some preset gratuity amounts , just circle the one you 'd like to apply .|&|- 15 % - 18 % - 20 % - 22 % '' Kacey had circled the 20 % option and wrote the new total at the bottom because I guess she thought that that was what she deserved .|&|After she dropped the bill , we noticed she was constantly circling our table , waiting for us to provide a method of payment .|&|We were a party of 3 and even though we are young ( early 20s ) we know how to tip .|&|It was pretty insulting .|&|I get it , you work in the heart of Vegas where many international visitors are n't aware of the customs .|&|But that does n't mean assume everybody is like that .|&|After talking it over amongst ourselves , I got her attention and pointed out what the receipt stated and said that if it says that , then the gratuity amount should really be up to our discretion .|&|She tried to cover it all up by saying something like , `` Oh , that was just a suggested amount , if it 's that big of a deal I can just take it off . ''|&|And she ripped off the bottom of the check .|&|I 've worked in the restaurant industry and servers face heavy disciplinary action for that type of behavior .|&|We still left a tip but the whole ordeal really just left a bad taste in our mouths .
I want to love this place so bad , but it wo n't let me .|&|There is some good , but a little more bad .|&|I am honestly surprised at the number of 5 stars .|&|I have been to the Esplanade probably around 6 times , and this is what I have observed ... . -The ticketing staff is always patient , helpful , and friendly - The bar- ugh .|&|My partner and I have officially given up on the bar .|&|They always seemed understaffed and grumpy .|&|Maybe AMC should have service bartenders that only work the service well ?|&|I have had the same bartender the last few times there ( ca n't remember name but her favorite movie is `` A Walk to Remember '' , and she does not smile at all and is not the tiniest bit friendly .|&|While there on Sunday , we had one round and she dropped off the ticket .|&|I had my card sitting on it for 15 mins .|&|( Really , 15 , because we were contemplating if we had enough time to go somewhere else before the movie . )|&|Three bartenders walked by repeatedly , not one taking my card .|&|We tried to get eye attention but were avoided .|&|We had to stand up and shuffle around to get the attention of one bartender who had passed us the most .|&|In previous visits , the service was always slow , and typically unfriendly .|&|-Servers- hit or miss , but a lot of misses .|&|In one incident my partner ordered a beer on draft .|&|The server said okay .|&|Between 15-20 mins later a different server approached us and said they did n't have that particular beer .|&|Welp , that would 've been nice to know .|&|A different beer was ordered .|&|Another 20 mins passed before we got that beer , by that time we were over it and sent it back .|&|That seems pretty typical .|&|Drinks take as long as food .|&|Refills can be difficult to come by .|&|I often see servers running food to the wrong people .|&|Last time , we saw our order whiz past us and then back out the theater .|&|We tried flagging the server down , but it was too late .|&|I certainly was n't going to chase after her .|&|It took another 3 or 4 mins to get our food .|&|On the bright side , the servers are at least all friendly .|&|( Especially compared to the miserable bartenders ) -The atmosphere is fun , the location is ideal , and it 's very clean .|&|The theaters are spacious and comfy .|&|AMC has a great concept here , but they definitely have a long way to go !|&|I am not sure if I will give this place another chance or not .|&|Maybe just a matinee where all we want is sodas ?
We happen to drive by the place and decided to stop by and eat for lunch .|&|We decided to dine-in .|&|We ordered egg rolls , I had the kung pao shrimp lunch special , and the husband had sesame chicken lunch special ( for the lunch special you get fried rice , lo mein and a drink ) .|&|To be honest the place looked like a dump .|&|The walls were covered with food stains of some sort ( looks like boogers ) .|&|The chairs wobbles and the tables were chipped .|&|Looks old and worn down .|&|( if only I had seen all this before our food arrived ) We were kind of worried that we might get food poisoning , but we took the risk .|&|The eggs rolls were okay , nice and hot , crispy on the outside , but for my taste very bland .|&|The kung pao shrimp was okay , I expected to have more shrimp , but their were only about 6 , their was some nice flavors .|&|The rice and lo mein were also bland .|&|They had some onions in the lo mein that tasted awful , which made the whole lo mein taste bad .|&|The lo mein tasted so bad that I had to spit it out ( I think the onions were old ) .|&|The sesame chicken was good .|&|It was crispy on the outside and you get a whole bunch compared to the kung pao shrimp .|&|Their was tons of sauce with the sesame chicken , no complaints there .|&|But the husband did agree that the lo mein was pretty awful .|&|The service was good .|&|The lady who took our order was friendly .|&|Our food came out less than 10-15 minutes .|&|The question is , would we come back here again ?|&|No .|&|Would we recommend the place ?|&|No .
I 've been here a few times for lunch uptown .|&|Its nothing amazing but its extremely convenient since its located in the Wells Fargo building .|&|If you 're looking for quick and simple lunch , this is the place to come .|&|You can avoid lines and its very quite with a view out the window towards the street .
Just do n't bother ... Had dinner here last night for my birthday because apparently several of my husband 's coworkers highly recommended this place .|&|I 'm not sure what food they 're used to that they consider this good , but I certainly did not .|&|The highlight of our meal was the appetizer and the vegetable of the day .|&|Other than that , it was barely edible .|&|Starting with drinks , I had a pear martini and hubby had a Long Island iced tea .|&|The martini was thick and excessively sweet .|&|Tasted like cheap pancake syrup .|&|The Long Island was standard , nothing great but not bad .|&|Though I would suggest a different glass or maybe a different colored straw , because halfway through our meal someone walked by ( not our waiter ) and topped it off with regular iced tea before we could even say anything .|&|For an appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail .|&|I 'd say this is pretty hard to mess up , but what made it really great were the sauces .|&|It came with cocktail sauce as well as a jalape√±o sauce .|&|They were both fantastic !|&|I assumed they were made in house , but I guess it 's quite possible that the 1 thing we liked was n't even made in the restaurant .|&|For dinner I ordered scallops ( not on the menu , they were a special ) with the vegetable of the day , and hubby had the BBQ trio with fries .|&|My scallops were awful .|&|They came atop a lemon beurre blanc .|&|Both the sauce and the scallops were cold , they were missing the beautiful sear that I expect to see on scallops , and they were undercooked ( still slimy in the middle ) .|&|The vegetable of the day was a corn salad .|&|That was the only good thing on the plate .|&|It had corn , tomatoes , zucchini and queso fresco and it was delicious .|&|I plan to make it at home .|&|Hubby 's BBQ trio was nothing special .|&|It had pulled pork , ribs , and rotisserie chicken .|&|The meats were cooked well , the problem was the BBQ sauce was sugary sweet .|&|Not really to our liking .|&|The side of fries was the worst part of the dish .|&|The menu touts fresh cut fries , well let me tell you , what we got was a soggy , greasy pile of junk .|&|They did n't even look appetizing .|&|I wish I had gotten a picture of them just to see how many people might actually be willing to eat them .|&|I 'm sure not many .|&|As far as decor goes , if you 've ever been in a Firebirds , you 've seen the inside of this place .|&|Everything from the dark wood , to the open kitchen , to the back-lit liquor bottles at the bar .|&|It 's all the same .|&|And the food at Firebirds is much better .|&|The one positive I can speak to ( and the only reason for giving 2 stars instead of 1 ) was the service .|&|We had a reservation and we were seated very quickly even though we arrived 20 mins early .|&|And our waiter was very attentive and friendly .|&|Unfortunately , the food was so bad I do n't expect to ever be back .
I really wanted to like this place , but I was truly disappointed .|&|The entire system from placing your order to receiving the final product is disorganized .|&|I chose s'mores and was given vanilla ice cream with a single smushed up 1/2 graham cracker ...|&|Which you could not taste .|&|The unlimited toppings are nice , but the flavored combos are virtually tasteless so make sure you load up on the toppings .|&|Cost- too much , 14.00 for two people to have subpar ice cream .|&|The location is perfect and it was clean .|&|Unfortunately , the only thing enjoyable was the novelty , which fell flat as soon as you tasted the product .|&|I hope it improves as time goes on
Good food but the service is always terrible .|&|I feel like each time I go the wait times get longer and longer especially in the drive thru .|&|I went for breakfast and got half my order in 10 minutes but had to wait an additional 15 for the rest of it !|&|First half was cold by the time I got everything .
I received services at both the spa and salon and I must say the spa was amazing !|&|The salon , however , was very subpar .|&|I went in for a partial highlight and blowout .|&|I was assigned to an older man named Gianni who was their `` color specialist . ''|&|My hair is naturally pretty light so when I go for highlights I ask for a low level bleach which I told Gianni .|&|He proceeded to color my hair using a strange board to hold the hair while he was highlighting .|&|The board seemed to keep him from painting the root of the hair and upon completion I realized it looked like I already had a month 's regrowth !|&|The highlights were also much lighter and needed to be toned once I returned from my trip .|&|I love the Wynn but this salon seemed more Jersey than an extension of the Steve Wynn branding .|&|I will definitely NOT be returning to the salon .
Took a longer/more expensive route to save 2 minutes and then took 8 minutes to get change from other cab drivers .
Sam Fox comes to Gilbert ! ! ! !|&|Yayyyy ! ! ! !|&|^that was my initial feeling prior to dining at the highly anticipated Zin burger .|&|I dined here opening week , and again three days ago as a second chance in hopes the kinks would be worked out .|&|Not so much .|&|The servers on both occasions seemed unfamiliar with the menu specifics and lacked the confidence and personality I am used to from the other Fox Concepts .|&|Both visits I ordered the same thing ... .sweet potato fries and the garden vegetable salad .|&|The fries keep this review afloat .|&|They are perfectly crisp , and the dipping sauce is nothing you would expect but everything you would want .|&|Yum .|&|Order two servings .|&|The garden vegetable salad has all the makings of a vegetarians dream , with the added bonus of the almighty quinoa to boost the protein .|&|Too bad they DRENCH it in salad dressing .|&|I had to actually spit it out because the dressing was so potent .|&|Pools of it in the bowl and the spinach looked like seaweed from being so wet .|&|I asked to have another one with out the dressing and it took them 25 minutes to bring the new one .|&|The manager did n't verbally address me , or the soup ... .I mean , salad .|&|She did comp the salad , but I have no incentive to go back for another round of this .|&|My husband is probably accurate when he said `` you ca n't order a salad when you go to a burger place '' .
I took out a French onion soup tonight .|&|Oh my gosh .|&|Oh my gosh .|&|Amazing .|&|The broth was perfectly and heavily peppered -- which made it even more divine .|&|If there was a drop of water in this broth , I did not taste it .|&|It was rich and full-bodied .|&|The take-out version comes in two smallish sized containers , each bearing a slice of ( French ? )|&|bread soaked in the heavenly broth .|&|Add this soup to my list of favorites on the West side .
I still give their food the top score .|&|I had the tom yum soup again , followed by a delicious tofu and vegetables dish which was served in a nouveau style -- on a flat rectangular plate , with a pyramid tower of rice .|&|The dish had avocados , red and green peppers , onions and carrots and was heaven to the palette .|&|I was there during the busy lunch hour when the place was packed .
Oh my goodness -- the happy hour here is amazing !|&|Such a deal for such delicioso chompings .|&|I loved their sophisticated mac and cheese and everything else I sampled somewhat recently , though not recently enough , for me to provide a full-tilt boogie review .|&|The wine was excellent -- I recall that I had Riesling that fateful night not so long ago .|&|And dessert -- I must 've -- I did -- stick around for that crowning jewel of any meal -- it was fabulous indeed .
The peanut butter-banana-caramel shake I had yesterday was spectacular !
Creme br√ªl√©e cupcake : my reaction after consumption = How .|&|Do .|&|They .|&|Do .|&|It ?|&|It is so delicious I have to temper myself and make sure to only buy small quantities .|&|It 's magic .
This is my go-to Starbucks .|&|Because of the multi-level layout , I usually have a few options of where to sit , and my favorite place is the main level .|&|There are two tables , one of which facilitates easy-access to one 's laptop without discomfort -- to those of us dealing with back issues , this is great .|&|The baristas are kind .|&|I recommend .
I visited today for the second time and feel like the vibe here is perfect .|&|The people who run this shop are friendly and made me feel welcome as I sat at the counter where a cool yellow phone from another era ( i.e .|&|80s or earlier ) sat .|&|I ordered the dark sourdough with goat cheese ( $ 5 for two thick slices with ample amounts of goat cheese slathered on each ) .|&|It was delicious , filling and reminded me of similar cuisine I had at a museum restaurant in another city recently .
This place is AWESOME .|&|You must go here .|&|I ordered two fish tacos yesterday and they were outstandingly delicious -- fresh , flavorful , lime wedges provided on the side .|&|It was $ 8 and it was the best meal I 've had all week probably .|&|I also enjoyed tasting two wines -- one a Riesling , the other a Rose -- at the wine stations they have in this store .|&|The service is second-to-none .|&|The people who work here are the best .|&|Go immediately , I implore .
It 's awesome .|&|I got a vegan sandwich to take out and it was loaded with marinated eggplant , olives , greens and other morsels of tastiness .|&|I had a salted dark chocolate chip cookie with it .|&|Like the sandwich , the cookie also came loaded -- this time with chocolate chunks .|&|The cookie was not soft , rather it had a nice crunch as I bit into it , which I really liked .|&|It was amply sized as well , which pleased me .
I love the lobster corn chowder .|&|It was delicious beyond measure .|&|Some lobster soups ( which are usually bisques ) tend to be too thick and creamy .|&|This soup was not thick , but had just the right amount of body ; it was the perfect texture .|&|The corn and lobster bits balanced nicely with what I thought might be whole milk , as opposed to full-throttle cream .|&|You get what you pay for in spades at Lemon Falls -- with a price tag of $ 8+ ( dine in ) , one might do a double take .|&|But it was , without a doubt , worth every penny .
I tried their brownies and chocolate chip cookies today at the Cleveland Flea .|&|Both items were delicious , so much so that I bought one of each after sampling .|&|These items DO NOT TASTE vegan .|&|They are rich and complex in flavor and texture .|&|I am excited to go to their store in Lakewood next month when they open .
I dropped by the other day because I was in the area .|&|After seeing the `` pizza by the slice '' sign , I figured I 'd try two slices and see how it was , since it had been at least three years since last having their pizza , and I was n't starving .|&|I ordered one topping , which was garlic .|&|I *love* garlic .|&|I guess I expected regular-defined as `` normal , '' sized pizza slices .|&|But I was pleasantly surprised when I got a regular-sized pizza box and saw that the TWO slices took up practically THE ENTIRE BOX .|&|These slices were that large .|&|I was very pleased !|&|The New York style pizza is wonderful and I will be back .
This place is freakin ' amazing .|&|Consider that you are in Cleveland , Ohio -- then close your eyes and imagine that you have been transported to a hip , clean , gorgeous beach somewhere off the coast of Highway 1 in California .|&|This is a restaurant you would encounter on that stretch of highway .|&|This is worth paying for .|&|I love the sandwich they have here and get it whenever I can .|&|It features toasted coconut , avocado and other delicious vegan toppings served on lovely fresh toasted bread .|&|The cashew mylk with lavender is my favorite drink so far .|&|I went in today looking for carrot juice .|&|They had a delicious offering of carrot/beet/pineapple/ginger/red pepper cold-press raw juice .|&|It was awesome .|&|It was not cheap .|&|It was totally worth it .
I had the opportunity to watch the owner make macarons and it was fascinating to me as I had never realized or thought of those delicious treats as being made right there at the store -- but indeed they are .|&|Ground almonds and egg whites ( and possibly sugar ) are the only ingredients that go into the macarons , save for whatever filling is going into the particular flavor being made at that time .
I went last night and had the Painkiller Level 1 .|&|It was fantabulous .|&|It is a combination of pineapple , coconut and rum .|&|And some spices added on top .|&|It was to die for delicious .|&|So I 'll be returning to this place .|&|The bartender Sean ( or Shawn ) ( sp ? )|&|was a good communicator and told me the tale of his coming to Porco .|&|General Manager Shannon provided more commentary .|&|This place is well-run and the atmosphere is uniquely Tiki .
Oh yum .|&|So yummy .|&|Scene : Monday night happy hour at the bar with my friend Steve , who recently celebrated a birthday .|&|I had the salmon burger -- it was cooked just right ( medium rare ) and came with asparagus and red tomato slices , and had a spiced mayo-esque sauce on it .|&|A helping of what seemed to be homemade potato chips rode shotgun -- tasty when dipped in the tangy tamarind sauce that came with Steve 's fried calamari .|&|He also ordered the ( New England ) clam chowder .|&|I asked for a slurp and Steve obliged .|&|After slurping , I silently resolved to get a bowl the next time I 'm at this establishment -- it was perfect .|&|Not too thick .|&|My father would have flipped his wig .|&|And he preferred Manhattan clam chowder .|&|We shared a mocha cake for dessert that came with dollop of berry sorbet and a good-sized shaving of chocolate on top .|&|Curtis , the gracious bartender , not only offered a recommendation on desserts for the occasion , but also brought us out a dish of three or four chocolate-covered strawberries after I mentioned it was Steve 's birthday .|&|I 'll say it again : Curtis -- you are a gentleman and a scholar .
Okay fine , I 'm addicted .|&|Chalk another one up for the books .|&|My first review perhaps was not fully thought out or the sticker shock might have rubbed me the wrong way .|&|But mark my words , these bagels are worth $ 1.50 each ( sans cream cheese schmear ) .|&|I buy 6 and eat one on the way home .|&|I slice the others in half and freeze 'em .|&|I take one bagel out each morning and toast it , schmear it with butter , and voila !
I went here today for lunch and got the spicy tuna roll to go .|&|It was excellent .|&|The flavor was not fishy or overwhelming -- it had just the right amount of kick .|&|Also -- you get a good amount of food -- there is no skimping here -- which made it well worth $ 7.99 .|&|The roll is made to order right in front of you -- if you want to add additional toppings , you can .|&|The toppings looked very fresh and they put your roll in a cool white cardboard `` roll in/roll out '' box .|&|They also have a happy hour at this place that they told me about , and asked if I wanted a shopper 's type card .|&|I did .|&|This is a nice place .|&|The staff answered questions I had about toppings and how to prepare seaweed sheets I have at home .|&|Very helpful .|&|I will be back .
I 'm going all in on this one .|&|And it is due to more than just amazing food .|&|Our server was a professional -- that was clear from the start .|&|We ordered a date milkshake to split and the lovely young lady brought us our milkshake to share divided between two cute glass drinking cups , each with its own spoon and straw .|&|Now that is what you call service .|&|I was very pleased .|&|I was even more delighted after I tasted the concoction , which easily rates 5 stars in my book .|&|Rich vanilla ice cream with bits of dates throughout , giving the shake a little taste of heaven in every sip .|&|Yum .|&|I ordered the Louisiana Shrimp Burger .|&|This was my second visit to Flipside , but I had not been there in over a year , I would say .|&|The burger was divine .|&|Succulent shrimp in a thick patty form , with pickles , a tomato , and lettuce .|&|The only things that were less than great I avoided .|&|These were 1 ) a fried green tomato that looked to be overly greasy .|&|Because my stomach reacts unwell to greasy fare , I de-fried it by removing the breaded and fried part of the green tomato .|&|The other qualm was a creamy sauce on the side that came with the shrimp burger .|&|I do not like cream sauces and so I passed on that puppy .|&|Otherwise this place rocks .|&|Will return .
I saw the other two reviews and thought -- this can not be correct -- better put in a true account of this festival .|&|This is the truth : this is the best festival in Cleveland .|&|A diverse array of cuisine representing the diversity of the continent of Asia .|&|A world-class entertainer or entertainers have been brought in in the past few years .|&|A child-friendly environment , one where you will feel comfortable bringing Junior and will be able to take him on a fun trolley ride through Asiatown .|&|Free parking .|&|Yes -- you read that right -- free parking .|&|Last year the highlight for me was meeting Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson , I must admit .|&|But a close second to that would probably include drinking a refreshing coconut water -- right out of the coconut .
This place is wonderful .|&|Marguerite ( I might not be spelling that correctly ) helped me today .|&|She was amazing -- her knowledge and customer service skills are second to none .|&|She saved me and my car from a blowout by recognizing that I needed oil in the vehicle .|&|This woman knows her business well .|&|I 'd go to this BP again any day and recommend Marguerite and her fellow associates .|&|They are great .
When I think of Heinen 's of Bainbridge , I ca n't help but musing `` What more could one ask of a supermarket experience ? ''|&|The answer is simple : nothing .|&|A warm , caring staff who over the years I have come to think of more as friends than sales associates .|&|A few names come to mind , and in the interest of sharing my appreciation for them , I will name them : Michelle is great at the service desk .|&|Rita has answered the phone on several occasions when I called to ask about food storage or preparation .|&|Frank is in produce .|&|Anita in the cheese section .|&|All of these wonderful people , along with their colleagues , make my shopping experience there as enjoyable as a walk through the park on a sunny day , ice cream cone in hand .
This is authentic Thai food that is fresh and piquant .|&|I had the tom yum gum soup and it was excellent -- nice and spicy , featuring shrimp , mushrooms and cilantro .|&|Also worth every bite was the superior summer rolls -- shrimp , rice noodles , carrots and another thing wrapped in rice paper rolls .|&|Yum .|&|I 'm happy .
Back today to get my fix : banana chocolate muffin and peanut butter/hot chocolate/alcohol concoction .|&|I also got a carrot/orange juice in a bottle .|&|The best thing today though : the awesome man behind the counter wrote down the recipe for a tumeric/almond milk drink for me so that I could put the recent canister of tumeric I purchased to use !|&|I made it when I got home and it is AWESOME .|&|Thank you !
I went to Green Tara Yoga tonight after having lower back pain that has persisted over the course of many months .|&|I have been to other yoga places , most recently the place on W. 25th St. in Ohio City .|&|Green Tara Yoga is the best experience I have had by far .|&|If you are a teenager or a cheerleader , or want to listen to calming nature sounds and smell incense , you should not come here .|&|But if you honestly want and need to feel better -- if you have body aches and want a place that takes these issues seriously , Green Tara is your place .|&|Karen took me and my issues seriously and she knew what she was doing .|&|This woman is an expert .|&|I thought I 'd try it for one night , and ended up signing up for eight classes this evening .|&|I am pleased .
I love Chick-Fil-A .|&|Just wanted to get that out there .|&|I love their grilled chicken sandwich , which is what I always order .|&|Their lemonade is also good .|&|I used to get the little chicken nuggets and have always liked them as well .|&|So to review , Chick-Fil-A is awesome .|&|Their staff is always very kind and provide superior customer service .|&|I am a major fan .
This is a supreme experience -- one that any grocery shopper worth her salt should have .|&|Heinen 's of Rocky River is a gem .|&|I love going grocery shopping -- it is my joy , it is my passion .|&|It is my luck that I live near this Heinen 's .|&|It 's the only grocery store I shop at on the Westside .|&|The people who work here are knowledgeable about their products and are always willing to answer questions .|&|I call the store ahead of time to confirm that certain items ( Yasso Greek Yogurt Bars -- coconut flavor ) are available and they are always kind and gracious .|&|I 've even ordered something from their Bainbridge store ( wine produced in Chagrin Falls ) and they transferred it over to the Rocky River location so I could pick it up .|&|Such customer service practices are rare -- but they are routine at Heinen 's .
This place is absolutely delicious !|&|The food is authentic and the service is fantastic !|&|I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience !|&|Will be returning soon !
My dog `` Gibson '' is in the Palm Glen Animal Hospital as I write this review .|&|I 've been dealing with Dr. Mangone and the Palm Glen staff for a couple of years now .|&|Even though I 'm not sure what Gibson 's outcome is going to be , I am comfortable and confident that he 's receiving the best care and comfort on this planet .|&|These people are saints and I would never think of taking my pets anywhere else .|&|Michael Anderson
Our server Tim was amazing !|&|Great drink reviews and was super fast and friendly .|&|Would go to this place again for the great service and location .|&|We were able to sit outside on a patio bar right on the strip .
This is a great , intimate , and special gem of a place with fantastic creations from the James Beard award winning chef , Nobuo , in the Heritage Square 's Teeter house , a historical old house with hardard floors and simple understated elegance , all in the heart of DT PHX .|&|In what could be described as Izakaya Fusion small plates , or what one might call `` Japa Tapas '' , made with attention to detail , flavor and texture , at reasonable prices , this place was part of Phoenix Yelp 's Eats Week recently , with rave reviews from Yelp Foodies .|&|In a cozy , quiet room with only 4 tables , with dark hardwood floors and minimal decorations , the two of us split the following : Small Bites Kimchi ( $ 6 ) - napa cabbage , dried shrimp , seasme oil , red chili .|&|Instead of the Korean staple fermented and limp , this was fresh cabbage with a lively flavor , crisp and crunchy , as a salad rather than a pickled side dish .|&|Excellent !|&|Nasu ( $ 8 ) - eggplant , bacon , red miso , Tokyo negi - this small bacon wrapped morsels stuffed with eggplanbt and akamiso , with shaveed green onions .|&|( 8 small pieces ) Heavenly !|&|Others not tried : Shishito Pepper , Watermelon Goat Cheese salad , Tempura Squash Blossom ( All $ 10 or less ) Cold Dishes Yellow Tail Ceviche ( $ 14 ) - myouga , sesame seed , sherdded taro - a superb blend of textures from the Hamachi to the Taro shavings , caressing the palatte with sultry pleasure ( 4 pieces ) Tako and Tomato ( $ 16 ) - fresh grilled octupus , house made mozzarella - like a mini-Italian Caprese appetizer , with half a cherry tomato , a small ball of mozzarella , a touch of basil , and a scored , pounded , grilled tender piece of white octupus !|&|Outrageous yet comforting in its combining recognition with a new ingredient !|&|Others not tried : House cured Salmon , Ebi Salad , Grapefruit & Hamachi , Shiromi Carpaccio , Big Eye Tuna Tataki ( all $ 12 - $ 16 ) Warm Dishes Panko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich ( $ 12 ) - housemade focaccia , cucumber , kanzuri aioli - this is not your daddy 's crab sandwich !|&|Crispy soft shell , great aioli , a mouth watering delight !|&|Seabass & Mushroom ( $ 14 ) - seabass baked in parchment , garlic butter , sake , soy - delicate , flaky seabass soaking in a hearty sauce , on a bed of shitaki and enoki mushrooms , with a sweet sake , butter and onion base , tender , yet dripping with exciting goodness like a goddess in heat !|&|Others not tried : Okonomiyaki ( $ 8 ) - classic Kansai pancake favorite !|&|Pork Belly Buns , Fried Sodt Shell Shrimp , Warm Duck Salad , Yuan Yaki , Foie Gras , Coconut Curry Lamb , ( all $ 10 - $ 24 ) Dessert Chcolate Mouse with Green Tea Ice cream and chocolate syrup This is a terrific date place , intimate and romantic , or a Foodies orgasm , and all at reasonable prices for the quality of creations and food .|&|We had 2 small bottles of Junmai Sake ( $ 12 eacch ) but they have a huge selction of sakes going up to near $ 600 a bottle , as well as a good selction of beers .|&|Relaxed atmoshere , not hoity toity at all , not attitudes , very down to earth .|&|This is an excellent choice !|&|And of my many reviews , only 10 % or less get 5 stars from Wanugee , so you can trust my viewpoint and bell curve !
This is a great show for the entire family .|&|The costumes are spectacular , the set design simple but imaginative , the performances were all strong , the singing was a joy , and the music is Oscar winning .|&|What 's not to like ?|&|The theatre is one large bowl , without balcony , and there really are very few poor seats in the house .|&|Acoustics were superb .|&|About 16 years ago I watched the VHS tape of this movie about 100 times when my favorite relative was a toddler .|&|Consequently , I know the story , the music , just about every line .|&|The show plays very true to that movie , with a few minor adjustments , but otherwise , you will recognize each scene if you 've seen the movie .|&|They even cast the performers with voices very close to the original sound .|&|Maybe not quite James Earl Jones as Mufasa and Whoopie Goldberg as the lead Hyena , but pretty close .|&|Scar sounds like Jeremy Irons , Kimba and Nala sound similar , even the Toucan Zazu has the same British accent as the Disney movie , and you 'd swear the Warthog Pumbaa was Ernie Sabella and the Meer Cat Timone was Nathan Lane I loved the rich African singing , colors , and drum beats .|&|The chorus was full of African performers , supplementing the mostly American lead performers with a rich undertone of African harmonies in the larger numbers , with great Swahili chorals .|&|This opened on Broadway back in 1997 and won 6 Tony Awards , and has been here in Vegas at least 5 years .|&|As I recall , songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice won an academy award for their music as well .|&|After you 've ooohed and aaawed over the 7 or so Quebecois acrobatic shows on the Strip , this is a nice and fun change of pace .
Scottsdale used to bill itself decades ago as Western Town USA , or Cowboy Town USA or something like that , to convey a clean , wholesome , western spirit to itself , and bring in tourists to see it 's , well , Western-ness .|&|Not surprisingly , Scottsdale was built , grew , and expanded on old ranch lands , and the names of them are still in the buildings and developments off Scottsdale Road .|&|McCormick Ranch ... . Gainey Ranch ... .. Noodles Ranch ... ...|&|Wait a minute Noodles Ranch ?|&|Huh ?|&|Have you lost your Noodle ?|&|No , actually , I found it !|&|At Noodles Ranch , off Scottsdale Road !|&|This Vietnamese restaurant has been here for 6 years , not long after I left the Valley of the Sun in 2004 back to California .|&|If it was here back when i was , I would have been a regular !|&|Unlike the divey Viet diners of San Jose or Westminster , where decor is dominated by plain tables and standard issue stackable red chairs , and service is by a grumpy old Viet dude who does n't speak English or smile , Noodles Ranch is perfect for Snotsdale , er Scottsdale .|&|It has a very pleasant decor of painted walls , tasteful artistic symbols of Vietnam artwork , large red , hanging upside down paper umbrellas , 4 cooling ceiling fans , a decorated cashier counter in front of the kitchen , and better quality table and chairs than their Little Saigon counterparts .|&|Scottsdale prefers looks over substance , so it likes nice decor in favor of good food , as exampled by the many large , formula restaurants with million dollar decors but mediocre food .|&|And remember , PF Chang 's , that popular faux Chinese chain , the epitome of Decor upstaging Taste , was started right here in the Valley of the Sun .|&|So seeing the tasteful decor , and seeing all the non-Vietnamese in the restaurant , kept my expectations very low on the food taste-o-meter .|&|But I was pleasantly surprised !|&|Now I lost count , but this is close to the 100th different Vietnamese restaurant i have eaten in all over the country in the past 4 years !|&|( see my Wanugee !|&|lists for Pho and Vietnamese for details . )|&|So I have tasted good and bad and everything in between .|&|And granted , I was starving from not eating all day , and here it is 7:00pm .|&|But when I ordered Cha Gio ( egg rolls ) , the 6 little crispy rolls came out beautifully plated on a large , quality made and decorative platter , and unlike most orders for this in those dives , which usually come out on a plain little white saucer plate by themselves , here , they were accompanied by several large leaves of romaine lettuce , pickled and julienned slices of cucumber and carrots , sprouts , basil leaves , cilantro and of course Nuoc Mam ( fish sauce ) to dip them .|&|Now most of the customers in here at the time would have dipped the rolls into the sauce , and probably poured the leftover sauce over the veggies , mixed them , and eaten them like a salad .|&|If this were PF Changs , that is what they probably would suggest .|&|But I took the leafy lettuce , put an egg roll on top of it , and sampled the veggie ingredients on top of that , rolled up the lettuce , and dipped all of that fresh tasty goodness into the Nuoc Mam .|&|This is much like how you might eat many other Vietnamese dishes in a Vietnamese restaurant , be it Nem Nuong , Banh Xeo , or even parts of Bo Bay Mon .|&|So I was impressed and happy with the refreshing mix of fresh veggies , crispy rolls and tasty fish sauce exploding into my mouth !|&|Loved it !|&|So I figured that was for show , however , to impress the Low Fan ( outsiders ) with a $ 5.95 fancy appetizer , with Scottsdale pizzazz .|&|Mais , au contraire mon frere !|&|The Pho Tai Nam ( $ 7.50 ) I ordered was very good !|&|I always try the broth first , and this broth had a very rich , complex flavor !|&|Perhaps a little sweet for the Low Fan , but very beefy , savory , and not too mucked up with masking ingredients to distract from the true flavor .|&|The meat pieces were whole and higher quality than most I have had , with good tenderness .|&|I had to ask for the separate condiment dish , where I mix the half Hoisin and half Sriracha , to dip my meat into , so as not to destroy the flavor of the broth .|&|I was smiling after this meal !|&|I even called up my Viet friend in San Jose , who could tell I was smiling over the phone , which they usually only notice after I have had good , authentic Japanese sushi or tasty and cheap KBBQ !|&|I would recommend this place highly !|&|It is a little more expensive than those $ 5.50 bowl dives on the coast , but the decor and quality of food , and the service from the owner , all combine to make a quality experience .|&|They offer all the usual Viet diner foods , like Goi Du Du , Goi Cuon , Mi , Com , Bun , Bun Bo Hue , etc .|&|They also offer two of my faves I will have to try another time , Banh Xeo ( crispy pancake ) and Canh Chua ( sweet-sour lemongrass soup ) .|&|So this is perfect for Scottsdale , with the nice decor , but with the added bonus of tasty , quality food !|&|They even play smooth jazz , something you would find in another Scottsdale staple - the SPA !
OK , I 'll admit that the old part of Vegas may be a riff raff magnet , what with the motels and dingy wedding chapels , a veritable Reno south , plopped into the north part of Las Vegas Avenue , amidst the CBD , city hall , and services for the not-haves .|&|But like Reno , you can walk to 6 casinos in the time it takes you to get from the elevator to the sidewalk in the southern strip mega-casinos .|&|And you can find cheap meal specials .|&|It 's not your glitz and glam and chichi night clubs and celebrity chefs , or $ 25 minimum table bets in cavernous themed casinos with a 20 minute walk to your car or 20 minute wait to get your car or taxi .|&|But I like Main Street Station .|&|It has an old west train station motif which is interesting but not why I like it , and like the California Hotel adjacent to it , it caters to Hawaiians .|&|That is why I like it .|&|Many of the people working here are from the Islands , and will slip into their Hawaiian accents , with that distinctive way of asking a question that drops down in tone , just the opposite of the Haole who 's question rises in tone .|&|And if you start up in pidgeon , they will pidgeon it up with you !|&|They know dakine brah !|&|The table stakes are low , usually $ 5 , but the odds are high , like 20X for craps bets .|&|And at the craps table , of which there are only three ( rarely all open at once ) , it is usually not crowded , with a relaxed island vibe , because nearly every craps gambler is Hawaiian , with tanned skin and almond eyes .|&|And they are friendly and relaxed , even when losing .|&|None of the bravado driven , money flashing , pseudo-high rollers looking for attention , to prove their self worth on a gaming table .|&|Nope , just down home `` local '' boys , who are humble with a great touch of island humor .|&|Even the croupiers will let you take your time , do your pre-roll craps ritual , and not hassle you about how you throw the dice , or agitate you with comments about throwing them too high , too low , too slow , like some casinos I wo n't mention ( actually , most of the bigger ones ! ) .|&|This goes for the other table game dealers , and the other staff .|&|If you relate to Brown , this is the place in Town .|&|It 's sort of like an extended family feel here .|&|Aloha spirit in Vegas !|&|The cafe has island type food to , with greasy plate lunch style meals , that remind you of food back home in the islands .|&|And the buffet is pretty good , and the sports bar-like dining area has good suds to suck'em up brah !|&|If you like Waikiki and Ala Moana shopping center in Honolulu , with the designer boutiques and fancy restaurants , go to the south strip , with those ever bigger monster casinos , trying to outdo the one just completed last year , go to the southern part of the strip closer to the airport .|&|But if you are a local boy , from Ewa , Mililani , Aiea , north shore , or somewhere outside Waikiki tourist traps , then come here and feel at home with the Brahs and Sistahs .|&|PS - I usually win here , and if I lose , I still have a good time !
Just about every one loves The Jersey Boys .|&|It is a great musical odyssey in the life stories of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons , who grow up from their youth and learn to `` Walk Like a Man '' .|&|You have a score based on all the hits of the Four Seasons and later of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons , from `` Sherry '' to `` Maryann '' .|&|The staging is surprisingly simple , with a clever bare bones set that still allows all the scene changes to occur quickly and creatively , with the help of lights and costuming .|&|The cast is excellent , with a talented group of main characters and just as talented satellite characters .|&|If you like good music , or remember the many Four Season or Frankie Valli hits , you will love this show !|&|The Jersey Boys : You 're just too good to be true , Ca n't take my eyes off of you PS - if you mind your kids hearing F bombs , do n't bring them !
The Wig Wam Resort is a sprawling complex west of Phoenix in Litchfield Park .|&|It has old school charm , with adobe inspired architecture .|&|There are 3 golf courses with 18 holes ; there are 3 pools , tennis , a conference center , and 3 restaurants .|&|It also has a full Elizabeth Arden Red Door spa , The rooms are large , probably big enough to fit 8 King size beds side by side in a 2 x 4 format .|&|The bathrooms are also large , with his and her sinks , separate shower cave fully tiled with a seat , large tub ( but no jacuzzi spouts ) , and a walk-in closet .|&|The furniture is large pieces of oak with a darker stain , and the colors are neutral sand and light cactus colors .|&|Most rooms have balconies or patios that usually face into the pool areas .|&|The property is well manicured and maintained .|&|Wig Wam is a Starwood property ( Sheraton , Westin , W Hotels , 4 Points ) , and part of their higher end Luxury Collection brand .|&|It is also an AAA 4 Diamond resort .|&|However , this time of year ( early June ) , it is very affordable .|&|The conference rate I was attending was less than $ 100 , but even the general best available rate was less than $ 150 .|&|I am sure that high season for snow birds the rates jump to over $ 300 .|&|As a full service resort , service is very good and everyone is very helpful and friendly .|&|Parking is a little problematic , as you have designated areas and then walking to your room maybe a little distance .|&|Of course they have full valet service , but self-parking is free .|&|There are a lot of Spa and Resorts in the Valley of the Sun , literally hundreds of them , like golf courses , too .|&|But if you like old world charm with a southwestern flavor , in a relaxed subdued atmosphere away from the show-off upwardly mobile wanabees of Scottsdale or Phoenix , this is a good choice , especially if you like golf .
This is the 2nd best sushi in Scottsdale , without being overpriced and over dramatized by $ 3 million decor , like most of the boring unauthentic restaurants in Snotsdale that snowboreds with money to burn go to get drunk .|&|They have Japanese chefs , and they give you huge and fresh , oversized but correctly sliced fish on nicely groomed rice .|&|You have to get here early , as it opens at 5:30 and fills up by 6 .|&|They have well prepared non-sushi dishes , too , and friendly service .
This place is a dive , a dump , in a shady strip mall off an industrial part of West Grand Avenue , on the west side of the Valley of the Sun .|&|But it has excellent Pho !|&|It is only fitting that my 900th review on Yelp !|&|is a review of a Vietnamese Pho Restaurant .|&|This is the 77th DIFFERENT Pho restaurant I have eaten Pho noodles in over the past 2.5 years on Yelp .|&|That 's about 31 new Pho restaurants a year I have been averaging .|&|More than one new Pho Restaurant every other week !|&|Troi Oi !|&|Also , over 20 % , or 1 out of every 5 of my reviews are for places that have never been reviewed on Yelp before .|&|FTRs as seasoned Yelpers would call it .|&|So suffice it to say , I do n't mind venturing out and trying new places .|&|And once in awhile , I find a little gem .|&|Pho Old Saigon , like I said , is a classic Viet dive .|&|Grungy strip mall , simple tables and chairs , no fancy decor , and gruff service .|&|But when I ordered my current favorite beef noodle combination , Pho Tai Nam ( rare and brisket of beef ) , a large bowl for only $ 5.95 ( small is only $ 5.50 ) , I was pleasantly surprised !|&|The bowl was placed in front of me , and I could smell the deep , rich aroma of Star Anise in the broth !|&|This is the essential smell ( and flavor ) of Pho !|&|And the broth was n't too muddy , so I knew that the broth was cooked with the flavor coaxed out of the beef bones and ox tails to create the rich aroma with plenty of Star Anise adde .|&|It was heavenly to inhale !|&|The beef was decent cuts of meat , and the Nam was tasty .|&|They gave me a full plate of condiments , and something I rarely see outside of only a few places in the Little Saigons in Westminster and San Jose : Ngo Gai !|&|Ngo Gai is the long , green , saw-toothed basil like veggie to add with the 2 stems of basil leaves they gave me to veggie up my noodle soup .|&|Plenty of bean sprouts , green chilis slices , and a large wedge of lime were available , too !|&|Perfect !|&|I took a small condiment dish , filled it half with Sriracha and half with Hoi Sin sauce , and was ready to go !|&|I tasted the broth first , all by itself , nothing floating in the soup , no added condiments yet , no sauces .|&|Just beef broth !|&|This is how I taste the the quality of the broth before I eat .|&|Mmmmm .|&|It was the best broth I have tasted in a Pho soup in many months !|&|It equaled in flavor to the best places out of the 77 places I have eaten Pho .|&|I sat down and watched the SBTN ( Saigon Broadcast Television Network ) that was playing on the TV , and started slurping !|&|Dipped my meat into my half/half sauce , ate it , then chased it with a good slurp of noodles and broth .|&|It was good stuff !|&|That bowl of Pho filled my tummy from lunch time to well into the late evening , too !|&|I had a Vietnamese Coffee with condensed milk to go with it .|&|The place was nearly empty , only a gathering group of Vietnamese local men converging into the early afternoon to talk and eat .|&|This is the best Pho broth I have tasted in the Valley , and in many other areas up and down the coast .|&|The place is n't for everyone .|&|It is hard to understand the staff , the place is dumpy , and it is n't in the greatest neighborhood .|&|But if you do n't mind a good Dive Diner atmosphere with excellent Pho broth and bargain prices , come here , breath in the broth , sip it , then start slurping !
Le Club Chasse et Peche ( literally , The Hunting and Fishing Club ) is like a secret Speak Easy of yesteryear , with only a sign with their emblem and a street address , with no name announcing what lays inside the unassuming Tudor styled facade on the bottom floor of a multi-story building in old Montreal , not far from city hall .|&|And like a Speak Easy club , inside lies a cave or cellar like chamber of rooms with low ceilings , brick construction , and dark paint covering the walls , with only highlight lighting resembling candles or torches in a medeival basement or monastery .|&|In Le Club , discerning diners , foodies , business people and Quebecois dine alongside the corrupted politicians and Mafiosa that have made the tabloids a-chatter with pay-off scandals of recent news .|&|The relaxed atmoshphere , paced professional service , and excuisitely delicious food make this a special dining destination in Montreal .|&|We had a party of 9 for a business dinner after a long day of meetings .|&|After a snail 's paced start ( I am not talking about L'escargot , but rather a slug 's traveling speed ) in which we were refilled water 3 times but not served bread or anything else until our wine was selected , things picked up very well into an enjoyable experience .|&|After starting with a Pinot Noir from France in honor of our Pinot Noir gentleman wine maker from Oregon 's famed Williamette Valley who graced our party , we finally had the limited menu handed out to us , and eventually read and explained to us , dish by dish by our servers .|&|The menu for the day had perhaps half a dozen appetizers and about the same in main entrees .|&|( See picture of menu for selections ) Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their selected delicate combinations of flavors and eye appealling presentations of both the appetizers and entrees .|&|The dessert and coffee was wonderful as well .|&|The prices were not that unreasonable for the quality of the food , but expect to pay about $ 15 - $ 22 for appetizer plates and $ 35 plus et moins for most entrees , with special mains going up to $ 50 .|&|Parking is non-existent and on the streets of Montreal .|&|There is a coat check room and a cute hostess to greet you .|&|Waiter service was professional , but relaxed .|&|The place does n't have a stuffy bone in its body , so you can enjoy the good food without feeling like you are being graded on your dining etiquette .|&|We all enjoyed our meals and would certainly come back again for another chance to break bread for business or dine with our favorite somebodies .
I love this place !|&|It is so great to find a true Japanese Izakaya anywhere outside Japan , and to find it in the `` Chinatown '' ( really , Asiantown ) part of Las Vegas was a real treat !|&|I was smiling the whole time eating here !|&|Izakayas serve a lot of little dishes and comfort foods like in a Japanese home .|&|They are not Sushiyas , so do n't expect that , although they may serve some sushi items .|&|Originally , they were drinking places , where salarymen in Japan would go and unwind , drinking a lot of booze , bond with co-workers , and even complain about or insult their bosses to their faces ( to let off steam ; and then they could always blame it on being drunk , because if they talked-back or disrespected at work , they would be fired or severely reprimanded ) .|&|So it was sort of a social safety valve place to relax in a strict culture of respect , protocol and obligation to the group and superiors .|&|The little food items were snacks to help the drinking .|&|But then , many places became very popular for their tasty snacks .|&|And now , it is a whole category of dining .|&|It is starting to become more popular in major cities in the US .|&|Los Angeles has some good ones , like Musha in Santa Monica and Torrance , or Raku in LA .|&|An Izakaya is different than a `` Snack '' or `` Hostess '' bar , which in many Asian countries , involves little in the way of food , but a lot in booze and pretty girls to make you feel like a big shot .|&|Izakaya in the US are usually family run , and down home , good for families and even kids .|&|( Pronunciation tip : do not accent any syllable , they are all even in intonation and emphasis : I-Za-Ka-Ya !|&|NOT iza KAYa ! )|&|This one has a million little dishes to choose from , listed on the menu , and many of the same selections taped all along the walls , mostly in Japanese !|&|The youthful waitresses and hostess here are all Japanese , so it is a delight , especially if you know a little of the language , because they will scurry around and respond promptly to your requests , as in Japan , with enthusiasm and energy .|&|If they were lazy or lackadaisical in their service in Japan , they would be severely reprimanded or fired .|&|Too bad that does n't translate to Denny 's here !|&|So this place serves what I like to call , Japa Tapas .|&|The two of us had Agedashi Tofu , Ikkayaki ( whole broiled squid , chopped up ) , grilled Black Cod ( like butter ! )|&|, Sake Ochazuke ( Salmon over rice mixed with green tea and flavorings ) and for dessert , green tea ice cream and 2 flavors of Mochi ice cream , and finally their signature dessert , which is 1/3 a loaf of bread crust filled with honey and vanilla ice cream that we shared with our tablemates .|&|We also had a small cold Kurosawa Junmai Sake .|&|All delish !|&|We sat at a community table and met another nice young Filipino couple enjoying their Izakaya experience , and shared stories and dessert with them .|&|I am coming back here every time I go to Las Vegas !|&|You should , too !|&|Forget those fancy faux Asian places on the strip !|&|OIshikatta !|&|Tanoshikatta !
Really excellent tacos and the salsa is flavorful and perfectly spicy .|&|The people who run the place are really kind and gave my aunt and uncle a taco sample on the house while the waited for us .|&|Really good food made by good people , what more could you ask for ?
If you like Peruvian cuisine , then this little gem is one you will have to try .|&|The Ceviche was very good with the seafood very fresh .|&|The little popcorn and dipping sacues that were provided as accompaniement were wonderfule .|&|The Pisco Sour is as good as I have every had .|&|This is a Lima , Peru cuisine , so if you are expecting something that is not from Lima , then you may be disappointed .|&|However , the food was wonderfule in all respects .|&|I will go back , hopefully many times as this was one nice surprise .
I agree with all the other reviews .|&|Wes , the owner , is a honest business person focused on customer satisfaction .|&|We are new to the Phoenix area and besides trying to find a doctor and a dentist , a car mechanic is a tough search .|&|Well we are searching no more .|&|Wes will be maintaining both of my vehicles here on out .
This is the best burger I have had in a very long time .|&|If you are craving a good burger , you have got to try this place !|&|!
This was a great place !|&|Thanks to all you Yelpers for giving it such a good rating .|&|I arranged for a business lunch there and was wonderfully surprised .|&|Great waiter , Brooks , took really good care of my colleague and I and the food was perfectly cooked .|&|We ate outside next to the canal on a Patio that was covered .|&|It was beautiful spring day and I will go back with family and friends anytime .|&|Cheers and Bon Appetite !
Guys came to the house and were prompt .|&|Shredded all sensitive documents right in front of me .|&|From the office staff to the driver , a great experience and would reccomend them to anyone who needs volume shredding services !
George showed up on time and had all the tools and materials to do the work .|&|He is a very pleasant person and did not waste any time .|&|I highly recommend George for any household projects you might have .|&|I had George do some concrete clean up and painting was very pleased with the results !
One of the best Asian grocery stores I have had the pleasure to visit .|&|I have traveled a lot and been in many different asian markets .|&|Mekong Supermarket has a wide variety of sauces , fish , meats , and spices that bring the orient into your home .|&|The prices are very reasonable and the fruit and vegetables are fresh .|&|I will be back !
At 3:30p , after the amazing rain event , we noticed that our A/C unit was n't working .|&|After making several calls , no one was available to come to the house to repair it for at least 24 hours .|&|When I called Sterling , they were able to come to my home within 1 hours .|&|Kevin showed up and was VERY pleasant .|&|Went straight to work and found the issue .|&|I had asked Kevin if he had time to add a 'hard start kit ' to the A/C , in order to prolong its life and also ordered a routine twice a year service .|&|I highly recommend Sterling for their professionalism and prompt service !
Recently purchase a Fantex Ash from here and had it delivered yesterday .|&|The tree was amazing and the delivery crew did an awesome job in planting the tree and cleaning up .|&|I highly recommend you shop here when in the market for for outdoor or indoor plants/trees .
I usually do n't write reviews .|&|I will make an exception in this case .|&|Sone was able to fix my car the first day I brought it to them .|&|They are very trustworthy .|&|I was satisfied .|&|I highly recommend them to anyone that needs their car repaired .|&|I live in the Boston area and wish I could use them myself .|&|I brought my sister-in-law 's car down when I recently was on a visit and noticed it did have a significant issue with it .|&|Thank you Sone .
First let me start by saying one of two dogs was pretty good .|&|They are both great dogs , one just needed a little more work than the other .|&|Bomber the Golden Retriever was just a `` happy '' dog with a lot of `` energy '' and Mickey , the German Shepard/ Basenji , was nice until someone came over or you directed him to anything .|&|They both had some basic training .|&|We 've had Bomber since he was a pup and recently adopted Mickey .|&|Mickey had some fear issues with new people .|&|We thought it was a territorial issue ... And Bomber just wanted to jump up and say hi to EVERYONE .|&|With Mickey nipping heals and 84 pounds of `` happy energy '' Bomber , we were looking for an alternative to using a gentle leader that worked but was n't correcting the underlying behavioral issues .|&|So all the research , reviews , and types of training considered we called Bob .|&|And now our lives are better .|&|The end .|&|Just kidding .|&|We ( my wife ) was tentative at first of using the collar on our dogs .|&|Bob had us touch them first to get a sense of what they boys would feel .|&|After a discussion of how the program works we were out and walking .|&|The first correction was less than exciting for Bomber and my wife .|&|But quickly he started adjusting to her commands and walked easily beside her .|&|Mickey was an old pro .|&|He walked fine and only needed a few corrections .|&|What ? ?|&|Yeah I know !|&|But , what happened once we were inside ?|&|The idea is that Mickey stays away from guests until he calms down .|&|Bob was able to identify what we need to work on and what we should expects .|&|Within two days Mickey no longer tries to heard or show aggression to visitors .|&|We worked with Bob for four weeks .|&|About half way through my wife said I can definitely see a difference in the boy .|&|Enough said !|&|Happy wife , happy life !|&|In addition we have two dogs who know various commands such as sit and stay and come when called and have a lot more freedom rather than always being on the leash .|&|I would recommend All American K9 to anyone whether you have a good dog you want to be great or a good dog with some issues you need help sorting out .|&|We still continue to work with our boys nightly and they only continue to show improvement .|&|Thank you for working with us !|&|-Greg LaMontagne
I came for brunch with some friends with few expectations .|&|I 'm normally on the west side and thought I was spoiled by the quality and quantity of places there , but Fourk was delicious .|&|My steak and eggs were honestly amazing .|&|The value for the dish is high , and I would highly recommend both the venue and the meal .
Authenic flavor !|&|Cozy environment !|&|Great restaurant ! ! !|&|Tried the place When we first moved to charlotte , it has become a regular place especially on Taco Tuesday !|&|They serve some of the best guacamole I 've ever tasted !|&|Highly recommend this place
Seriously some of the best food in Vegas and everyone who works there is amazing ... Stop in and check it out ...|&|It 's becoming a once a week must have and having incredibly healthy tasty food is so worth it ...
Melissa is totally amazing .|&|Come to see her for sure .|&|My daughter wants to just for her Harry Potter Art work .|&|Love the pictures thanks .|&|A good size list of beer on tap .|&|Folk music in Vegas .|&|I will be back for sure .|&|Not a dive bar by any stretch .|&|Bright airy and the food is fresh and healthy .|&|Everything you expect in a Whole Foods .
Awesome group of workers .|&|They were so helpful even while getting ready for an inventory .
Stopped in today to sell my coins .|&|Great service and I think I got a fair deal .|&|All in all a really nice experience .|&|David and Nate were both really nice .|&|Hence the 5 stars .
Our new favorite taco spot !|&|Cool vibes , great food and service .|&|Looks like they have some amazing drink options too .|&|The patio was nice and even kid friendly : )
If you 're looking to grow you eyebrows out , get a nice shape and you 're weary of trying a new spot -- this place is safe !|&|I had a HORRIBLE experience with threading a few years ago and I 'm still growing the middle part of one of my brows back .|&|As a result , I had sworn off threading .|&|I 've been to a few other wax brow bars that were ok but mostly maintained my own brows for the past few years -- which usually resulted with me plucking way too much late at night in a bathroom mirror and waking up with regrets .|&|Until I found this place !|&|Recently , the new shop showed up in my yelp eyebrow search and I could n't believe all the positive reviews and before/after pics .|&|I decided to give it a shot and now I 'm hooked !|&|First , who can beat $ 8 for brows ? !|&|And Farida , the owner is so sweet , patient and very gentle with threading .|&|I remembered the process being a lot more painful but she does such a great job .|&|She 's also great about helping you map out your brows if you 're trying to grow them out in certain areas ( like me ) .|&|I 've gone twice now and I 'll be coming back as a regular .|&|Her service is great .|&|The shop is clean and conveniently located with lots of parking in a plaza .|&|Gone are the days of me plucking away my brows or praying that the brow bar girl does n't get too rambunctious .|&|Soooo happy I found this place !
Do n't let the name fool ya .|&|Think mex-cowboy inspired breakfast/brunch dishes .|&|There 's definitely no deep down south `` soul food '' here .|&|Vibrant ambience and decor with bright wall colors , cowboy/girl and Native American inspired artwork throughout .|&|A large circular bar sits in the heart of this restaurant and it was slammin , especially for a Sunday afternoon .|&|I was pleasantly surprised by their choice of music - instead of country , they played Motown classics .|&|Seemed a little bizarre for the ambience but I 'll take it any day .|&|It was a busy Sunday afternoon , yet they managed to fit us in with no wait .|&|Our server was outstanding - engaging , attentive , fun and silly to top it off .|&|Food was great .|&|I see why people rave about it .|&|Lemon ricotta pancakes lived up to the reviews .|&|Triple play daily special consisted of three tortilla cups with eggs and different bean/salsa/chili fillings .|&|Each had a unique flavor and each was a little spicy and delicious .|&|Make sure you try the jalape√±o bacon !|&|Several kids meal options available .|&|The one we ordered had eggs and ham , came with rainbow potatoes , and was a great portion .|&|Not the `` soul food '' I 'm used to but still a great experience , fun environment , with unique dishes .
Believe the hype !|&|Great food and service .|&|So nice that they 're open late - it 's always a struggle to find GOOD food spots to hit up late night and now I 've found one !|&|Came on a Friday night and sat on the sushi side which was a bit quieter than the other burger side with the bar .|&|Waiter was super attentive and chatty , which I love : ) He gave us lots of recommendations .|&|I took a risk and tried the Delux sushi roll even though I do n't usually go for raw fish ( well , seared salmon is still raw to me ) .|&|It was soooo good !|&|Perfect amount of spice and so much flavor .|&|I ca n't wait to go back just to get it again .|&|They offer reverse happy hour and lots of drink/food specials .|&|Seem like they have a great dessert menu -- although the apple pie that 's posted in one of the pictures here on Yelp is no longer being served .|&|So do n't get your hopes up on that because I was pretty bummed !|&|They do have lots of other dessert options .|&|Be sure to try the mix of regular and sweet potato fries !
Sooo good and fresh !|&|I 'm a sucker for plain glazed donuts and there 's are so plump , doughy , and delicious .|&|You can really tell their fresh .|&|Nice selection of assorted donuts and I have n't had one that was n't good .|&|Their coffee is n't bad either , especially for a cheap donut spot .|&|Drive thru and combo meals are convenient and service is always great .
So glad I found this place !|&|My friend and I walked over on First Friday after a guy recommended it to us and described it as a place with great `` comfort food . ''|&|It 's a few blocks from the more populated , business portion of Roosevelt .|&|Since we were walking at night , it was a little sketchy given it was dark and there were barely any street lights .|&|But the food and service were well worth the 5 minute creepy walk .|&|Plus it made it more of an adventure ; ) This places feels like an outdoor diner , located on a residential block .|&|You order your food at a window and then find a seat outside in the cute little lot .|&|Despite the fact it was First Friday , the wait was n't long at all .|&|I think this is because , as I mentioned , it 's a bit off the main strip of Roosevelt .|&|We were able to easily find a comfortable place to sit and the service was great .|&|I loved how patient the woman taking our order was and her enthusiasm describing their menu : ) There 's nothing worse than when you 're excited to try a new place and the service is lackluster .|&|This woman took her time and even checked on us later once our food arrived .|&|I tried the crunchy peanut butter , bacon burger with pickles and cheddar cheese .|&|I know , right ? !|&|Sounds crazy !|&|It was highly recommended by the person in front of me in line .|&|And just way too weird for me to not try -- -and man , am I glad I did !|&|It was SO GOOD !|&|The flavors actually really complimented each other , especially the saltiness of the peanut butter/bacon and sweetness of the peanut butter/pickles .|&|The bun was also fantastic and fresh .|&|Descent beef portion too .|&|It came with a side of fries which were cooked to perfection .|&|I will definitely be returning .|&|There are a bunch of other delicious sounding items I 'd like to try .|&|A place with a cool , hipster vibe to it and the food , service , and unique menu are outstanding !|&|!
Finally found my favorite fresh seafood spot in the valley !|&|Wow .|&|What a hidden gem .|&|So glad I found out about this place from a friend after seeing her amazing looking food pics on Snapchat !|&|My husband and I came for lunch on a Saturday and it turned out it was `` National Oyster Day ! ''|&|Luckily there was no wait and we were greeted right away .|&|Our service was wonderful throughout the dining experience and everyone we encountered was super friendly and efficient .|&|Ambience was really upbeat , laid back , and an open bar feel .|&|We noticed they were setting up outdoor seating with another bar area , which I 'm sure gets pretty busy and looks great in the evening .|&|Now to the food - it was superb !|&|We tried the salt and pepper calamari with the Thai dipping sauce -- omg so good - may have been the best I 've ever had !|&|The sauce with peppers gave it a nice kick and was so flavorful .|&|Definitely getting that again !|&|We also ordered a few sushi rolls which were incredibly fresh and loved the unique combinations offered .|&|I believe one had macadamia nuts inside and another had almonds .|&|Those flavors merged well with the fresh shrimp , crab and other delicious fillings .|&|Feeling daring , my husband tried the raw oysters and surprisingly really liked them .|&|The cocktail sauce , horseradish and other tangy sauce they were served with really enhanced the oyster flavor .|&|Since we were filling up , we decided to split the crab cake blt and it was also excellent .|&|Next time I 'm saving room for dessert .|&|The couple next to us ordered some sort of merengue pie and it was HUGE .|&|Being the nosy girl I am , I had to lean over and ask how it was -- they said it was to die for !|&|I overheard the manager telling them the flourless chocolate cake is also her favorite and is served with an amazing flavorful gelato .|&|Yum yum yum .|&|Ca n't wait to return and show this place off to our friends visiting from out of town !
Dined here for our anniversary dinner and had a wonderful experience .|&|Rose petals and a `` Happy Anniversary '' card signed by all the restaurant staff greeted us when we arrived at our table .|&|Made us feel special .|&|Our waiter was professional and attentive our entire dining experience .|&|He came around between each course and switched our silverware and plating and cleared our table of any crumbs with that cool little gadget they use at fancy restaurants .|&|Food was delicious .|&|Lobster tacos - yum !|&|Crab corn chowder - double yum !|&|Chilean sea bass and seafood platter with king crab legs , scallops , crab stuffed shrimp ( special of the day ) - so delicious .|&|To top it off , because it was our anniversary , they gave us a choice of any dessert on the menu for FREE !|&|We went with the creme br√ªl√©e because we wanted a lighter dessert and it did n't disappoint .|&|Really impressed with the service and food .|&|The lighting also makes the ambience feel modern and upscale .|&|I would return here in a heartbeat !
Looking for something fun and different ?|&|If your significant other is a gamer and you 're looking to win major brownie points , come here !|&|I definitely got an excited , huge smile from the hubby when I surprised him and brought him here for Father 's Day ! !|&|Even with the sign `` Modern Round , '' my husband was a little unsure what to expect and exactly what we were walking into .|&|At first he thought it was a shooting range , not a virtual one .|&|He LOVES gaming and since he does n't get a chance to much these days , this was the perfect gift .|&|Upon entering , we were immediately struck by the unique , modern , upscale decor .|&|The hostess showed us to our lounge carrying the virtual guns in a locked metal box with an attached handcuff - a nice touch that kicked off our unique , upscale experience .|&|All the staff were super friendly , attentive and willing to take our `` Bonnie and Clyde '' pics !|&|Whoever thought of this concept is brilliant .|&|Think fancy , adult virtual shooting lounge meets restaurant/bar .|&|Love that you get your own lounge , server , that the food and drinks are actually yummy ... and there are n't a ton of kids running around ( unlike most gaming spots ) .|&|Fun place to come to with a group so that you can split the cost of the hourly rental .|&|Also a nice place to enjoy as a couple so that you can get more playing time !|&|So much fun - we 'll definitely be back soon !
Wow !|&|Who knew this place was even here and FREE on Thursdays ! !|&|Stumbled upon this museum today while walking an alternate route in the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall .|&|I am so glad I came in to check it out !|&|Currently there 's a Kahil Joseph exhibit w his film .|&|Two screens side by side show video footage depicting life in Compton paired with Kendric Lamar 's music make the experience pretty powerful .|&|Really unique .|&|Gift shop has some cool stuff too , including `` eracism '' t-shirts .|&|Friendly , helpful staff that offer free tours of all the contemporary exhibits .|&|Nice that you can spend as much or as little time in here and do n't have to feel guilty with free admission all day on Thursdays .|&|Also free on Fridays and Saturdays after 5pm .|&|Relatively small museum but it 's the perfect place to check out and get a nice reprieve from the heat .
Donut heaven !|&|This little shop sits in a strip mall and would be very easy to miss .|&|Thank goodness I had it bookmarked in Yelp and made a special trip to try it out or I probably would n't have ever discovered it !|&|Pulling up to the shop , one would n't expect to find the rows of uniquely flavored/topped donuts and baked gems .|&|Inside , the place itself is small and there 's not much decor other than a few pictures with donut flowers on a wall .|&|Greeted immediately upon entering , the worker was nice and willing to tell us a little about her favorite donuts and the history of the shop .|&|Apparently it used to be a vegan donut shop - so occasionally they get some disappointed customers who still think it is - thank goodness it is n't or they would n't offer maple bacon donuts like they do today !|&|To me , this place is the perfect combo of fluffy donuts found at Bosa and unique toppings and specially designed donuts at Fractured Prune .|&|If you prefer more cake-like donuts , they 've got you covered too .|&|Because they offered a sample of the apple fritter , I fell in love with it and ordered one .|&|I also had to try the creme br√ªl√©e because I 've never seen that anywhere else .|&|I do n't typically love filled donuts but the creme br√ªl√©e one was great and I 'd totally get it again .|&|And , of course , I had to order the maple bacon donut because , well duh ... it 's a maple bacon donut .|&|It did n't disappoint !|&|Extra bonus : coffee was good !|&|They offer a few different flavored carafes so I tried the Kona Blend and it was great .|&|Half and half or almond milk and a variety of sweeteners are provided at the little coffee station .|&|I got ta give it one more shot before I official declare this because donuts are serious business in my book -- but I think this is my new favorite , local donut spot !
This is my new favorite place !|&|I came for the first time yesterday and I 'm back again today ! !|&|Who knew this hidden gem was even here .|&|An old golf course converted to a beautiful farmers market/meadow , Singh Meadows is so peaceful and perfect .|&|Think lots of grass , a pond , space for kids to run around and play , nice seating , delicious fresh food and drinks .|&|I ca n't think of a more perfect place to enjoy life .|&|Free badminton , yard games .|&|Fresh produce and lots of cool local goods for sale .|&|I am in love with this place and I will come here often !
LOVE this shop !|&|Located right on Mill , this is a great spot to shop for cute little gifts .|&|They have all sorts of cutesy cards , coasters , wine glasses , jewelry , Arizona souvenirs , and even some aromatherapy soaps and bath/shower bombs .|&|They also make their own scented lotions and oils- hence the name `` Lotions and potions . ''|&|I used their Vitamin E and Jojoba oil blended into a lotion during my last pregnancy and it really worked to precent stretch marks !|&|If you 're looking for a cute , thoughtful bday , shower , or just-because gift , this place is great !|&|They 're staff are all also super helpful and friendly .
Ca n't beat the price and sooooo good !|&|$ 2 for an ice cream sandwich made with ice cream between two fresh baked cookies of your choice ! !|&|Open late which is nice for late night , pregnancy cravings ; - ) Warning : Do n't be turned off by the cookies in the glass case !|&|The first time I went I almost turned around and walked out without trying anything because the cookies looked so old and sad in the case .|&|Luckily , I asked the employee who explained those cookies are not the ones they actually use ; they bake fresh cookies every half hour for the sandwiches and use those .|&|Management may want to put up a sign explaining this or replace the cookies in the case every so often , because I almost left and would 've missed out on this amazingness !
Huge Flower Child fan !|&|This location is in a shopping plaza with some great stores .|&|It 's across the street from Shea Honor Health , which must be super nice and convenient for hospital employees , patients and visitors .|&|Always great service .|&|It gets pretty busy during lunchtime so expect a line .|&|They do a great job of managing and seating customers in line .|&|Also very considerate that they offer fruit infused water for customers .|&|Dine in and enjoy their casual dining or call ahead for take out and skip to their special takeout-only line .|&|I 've been here countless times and the food is so fresh and yummy .|&|Everything I 've ever had is always quite delicious .|&|Be sure to try their house lemonades - you can mix them and they also have crushed ice which earns bonus points in my book .|&|Some of favorites include the grains and greens salad , Mother Earth bowl , kale salad , and their soups are phenomenal -- especially the Moroccan chickpea soup - my God it 's good !|&|I am super bummed they removed my very favorite grains and greens salad from the menu and I hope they decide to bring it back soon because it was soooo good !|&|To management : please please please considering putting it back on the menu !
What a great hospital !|&|I delivered my daughter here and had the most wonderful birthing experience .|&|Hip hip hooray for epidurals !|&|The anesthesiologist I got was amazing and all the nurses said he 's the one they all request so I really lucked out .|&|Whenever I meet someone who is expecting I rave about Shea HonorHealth and hope for their sake they deliver here too .|&|Food was really good and their portions were huge .|&|If you want take out or you 're craving something else , there are so many other great restaurants across the street and in the area .|&|So clean , professional and well organized .|&|All the staff I encountered were super courteous and kind .|&|In the main hospital there 's a cute outdoor courtyard , gift shop , and coffee shop .|&|I also love and appreciate the educational courses they offer .|&|My husband and I took a newborn care class here and also came for a labor and delivery tour prior to choosing the hospital .|&|I highly recommend doing both .|&|It helped us feel more confident about the birthing process and caring for our newborn .|&|We toured two other local hospitals and they were n't nearly as nice .|&|This one has a pediatric ICU and a Level III neonatal ICU , which is comforting , God forbid you ever need that level of care .|&|Last , I think it 's awesome they offer free weekly meet ups for new moms .|&|`` Moms on the Move '' really helped me get out of the house , meet other new moms , learn about safety , nutrition , and other educational topics while acclimating to motherhood .|&|Thank you so much for providing top care to your patients and to the community !
I love Blancos !|&|My husband and I dined here during a visit before moving to Arizona and the fact that we were able to eat outside on the patio in December was such a wow factor to us , coming from Michigan .|&|This location off of Scottsdale Road has two garage doors that stay open most of the year which allows for a nice breeze and open aired dining .|&|Food - delicious !|&|Tex-Mex flavors are on point and flavorful .|&|Ambience - love !|&|Bar is in the center of the restaurant and they have two separate patios with outdoor seating .|&|Fun , upbeat environment .|&|Service - excellent !|&|Never had a bad server , they 've always gone above and beyond .|&|What I did n't realize is this is another Fox Concept Restaurant -- and once again they 've done an outstanding job .|&|Great spot !
MAN are these cakes good !|&|Great alternative for a pretty bday or special occasion cake , without the crazy high price .|&|Ordering process was awesome .|&|I was able to call the week of and got a 2-tiered 8 '' and 10 '' cake , 10 '' cake , and individual bundtlet that served as my 1-year old daughter 's smash cake .|&|This served about 45+ people !|&|It was also nice to order these smaller cakes too so that we could try different flavors .|&|We tried the chocolate chocolate chip , lemon , red velvet , and white chocolate raspberry .|&|They were all sooo delicious !|&|My personal favorite was the white chocolate raspberry .|&|I did n't get a chance to visit the shop as someone else picked up the cakes but I definitely want to take a trip out to see it and to try some other flavors .|&|My ordering experience was great and both women that I spoke to were kind , patient , and helpful .|&|I will definitely be ordering from here again !|&|!
I LOVE Beneficial Beans !|&|I love the concept ( benefiting autism , hence the name `` beneficial '' ) , I love the service , and I love that they allow you to have coffee and snacks in such a beautiful library !|&|It 's so nice to be able to pick up some much needed caffeine and a snack before enjoying story time with your little one or utilizing this awesome library .|&|I 've been here numerous times and the service is always wonderful .|&|The main barista is this really friendly guy who goes out of his way to thoroughly explain their menu items and make small talk .|&|He seems to genuinely care about your experience .|&|Even though he 's chatty , he 's also great about making sure you do n't wait as a customer .|&|I wish I knew his name because he 's really that great and charismatic .|&|I 've never tried their food but it always looks fresh and they have a nice selection , including various yummy looking salads , snacks and baked items .|&|This cafe has made my Scottsdale Civic Center Library experience even more enjoyable .|&|Five stars for sure !|&|*Bonus tip : Be sure to check out Scottsdale Mall/Civic Center Plaza behind the library ( north ) .|&|There is a beautiful park with fountains a few restaurants , and the iconic `` Love '' statue .|&|It also connects to Main Street in Old Town .|&|I never knew all of this was there until I stumbled upon it one day !
I ca n't believe I have n't reviewed Le Macaron after coming here so many times !|&|It is one of my favorite places for mommy meet ups and playdates .|&|Walking in , one would n't think `` kid friendly '' because it 's so pretty and chic .|&|Think lots of pink , feathers , chocolates , macarons , eiffel towers ...|&|I dream of designing one of my rooms like it !|&|The owners , a French couple , are the cutest .|&|So sweet and friendly .|&|It 's been really nice because they 've gotten to know my friends and I since our children were infants and now they are toddlers running around the place .|&|I look forward to bringing our kids here as they grow older .|&|It 's really nice to support a small , family-owned business , especially when they are so hospitable , charismatic and let our kids enjoy themselves ( even when they make a little mess ) .|&|Besides macarons which are quite pricy but delectable , Le Macaron offers croissants , gourmet chocolates , gelato , crepes , and my very favorite -- some sort of secret iced coffee that 's really really good !|&|The owners go into the back to prepare it and I do n't know what they put in it but it 's sooo good !|&|My friends and I often make plans to meet up here just for their iced coffee .|&|We then head out to enjoy shopping and letting our kids run around the outdoor area at Scottsdale Quarter .|&|Chic .|&|Yummy .|&|Come here .
Big fan of this spot ! !|&|I 've been here twice now and I 'm really impressed with the food , service , ambience and the location is just perfect .|&|Great place to bring people visiting from out of town so you can walk around old town before or after your meal .|&|The bridge is a great place to take pics .|&|The restaurant patio is super cute , overlooks the little river and reminds me a little of Europe .|&|Food is fresh and service is great .|&|They provide you with complimentary bread and fresh pesto .|&|I had to refrain myself from licking the plate !|&|I split a burger and kale salad with a friend and they actually split it for us which was super thoughtful of them .|&|Burger was fantastic .|&|Kale salad was huge , even when it was split .|&|I 've been for both brunch and dinner now and both menus are great .|&|Sometimes they have a live dj in the evening which creates a fun ambiance .|&|Love that they 've managed to create a classy place without it feeling too upscale or stuffy .|&|Prices are affordable too .|&|Ca n't wait to return and try their desserts !
LOVE this place .|&|Such a fun place to go for drinks , food , games with friends , family or for a date night .|&|They even have a free photo booth !|&|Food is great quality .|&|I never eat meatloaf but decided to venture outside of my comfort zone and it was really good .|&|Now I order it whenever I go !|&|They also have a great kale salad that 's large enough to split .|&|And they 're known for their pretzels .|&|On wknds they often have live music and on Sundays they offer specials on appetizers ( at least during football season ) .|&|Big fan !
I am not vegan and this place is legit !|&|I have driven past numerous times before venturing into this `` health '' spot .|&|One day , after being sick for a few weeks , I thought I 'd be adventurous and stop in for a fresh juice that might help fight the cold .|&|Man was I in for a treat and it has since become a favorite spot of mine !|&|Still a skeptic , I thought to myself , `` I better try this place a few times before writing a review . ''|&|Now that I 've been several times , I feel like I can truly vouch for this place .|&|I ca n't believe their meatless dishes are so delicious and flavorful !|&|So far , I have tried the following : -Hangry Tacos - Really good !|&|Not the largest portion but still a good size .|&|I was full after eating this dish .|&|They looked dry and unappealing but do n't let that discourage you from biting in and experiencing all the flavor !|&|-Raw Tree of Life Salad -- Huge ! !|&|Enough to split .|&|So many interesting flavors .|&|I prefer it with their vinaigrette over the tahini dressing .|&|-Portobello Cheese Steak Sandwich -- I was truly a skeptic of this dish and almost did n't try it .|&|I am SO glad I did .|&|It is by far my favorite dish and I ca n't wait to order it again .|&|Most of the juices I tried were primarily selected to help me get over a cold and were full of ginger , beets , carrots , and a few other Vitamin C packed fruits/veggies .|&|If you want a sweet , yummy juice , the Blue Pom Bomb is really tasty .|&|They can give you great recommendations on juices depending on exactly what you 're looking for ...|&|Which brings me to their service .|&|I am so impressed .|&|All the staff I encountered were super friendly and willing to answer any of my questions .|&|They provided excellent recommendations and because of this , I have tried great dishes I would n't have selected on my own .|&|I also like the layout of this place and it 's always clean .|&|They even have a cute , little , comfy corner nook with seating if you want to chill , read , or just hangout .|&|It 's also nice they offer both indoor and outdoor patio seating .|&|Even if you 're not a health nut , one day when you 're feeling adventurous , give this place a shot !
My go to Italian spot .|&|Looks very unassuming from the street as it sits in a strip mall .|&|Prices are great and it 's fun to look at all the authentic Italian groceries as you wait for your food .|&|My favorites -- lemon bars ( yes , dessert first !|&|They 're large and the best I 've ever had ! !|&|) , vegetable lasagna ( banging w artichokes and assorted veggies ) , the salad with chicken and goat cheese ( bomb ! ) .|&|Pizzas are great .|&|Interestingly I have n't tried their sandwiches yet but I ca n't imagine they 're anything less than great .|&|I also like their lattes , my fav is the iced salted caramel .|&|What a cool , authentic Italian grocery/takeout/eat-in spot .|&|I like that they have indoor and outdoor seating too .
This place has great pastries .|&|I 'm a big fan of the almond croissant ( esp if they warm it a bit ) and the hazelnut cake is to die for .|&|Soooo good !|&|They also have a nice crepe selection , both sweet and savory .|&|I 've tried both and they do n't skimp out on the fillings .|&|The apple strudel crepe was particularly good and the filling was n't too sweet and the apples were still crisp .|&|They have a nice coffee selection too .|&|I 've been a few times and the service has been wonderful each time .|&|Definitely one of my favorite bakeries in Tempe and I 'll be back often !
I 've had such a great experience at Warby Parker !|&|They are patient , helpful , and incredibly customer oriented .|&|Walking into the store , at first , since it 's located in Scottsdale Quarter and has an upscale look/feel to it , I was a bit intimidated and automatically assumed the glasses would be expensive and way out of my price range .|&|To my surprise , their glasses are actually super affordable !|&|Most of their glasses run around $ 95.00 and that includes the prescription frame and shipping !|&|I was super impressed with their customer service throughout the in-store ordering process , the email followup for submitting my prescription , confirming my order , and communicating shipping information .|&|What 's more is that you have 30-days to return/exchange your glasses , no hassle -- which I ended up doing because when I received them in the mail and tried them on at home I was n't 100 % in love .|&|Upon my return to the store to exchange the glasses for a new pair , the employees were again super helpful .|&|They emailed me my receipt and were also happy to answer my vision claims questions for out-of-network reimbursement .|&|Even though they 're considered `` out-of-network '' their glasses are still cheaper than most `` in-network '' options on my vision plan - plus they offer a lot more stylish options .|&|I 've been to this Warby Parker on three separate occasions now and each time I 've been super impressed .|&|I 'm so glad they just opened this Scottsdale location !
Best car wash I 've found in the Tempe area so far .|&|The complimentary air freshener and vacuums are nice and I also appreciate how they take the time to hand dry off your vehicle afterwards .|&|I always throw them a few dollars tip for that extra love : ) If you 're getting your car detailed , there 's a kona coffee/smoothie shop you can sit outside at while waiting that has decent drinks .
What an adorable spot !|&|Stumbled upon Sugar Happy while looking for a bookmarked lunch restaurant and after seeing `` coffee and bakery '' I was sold to return for dessert .|&|Who does n't want dessert after lunch on a Friday afternoon ? !|&|Upon entering , the ambience was super cute and very clean .|&|Decor was tasteful and unique .|&|I especially liked the little plants hanging on the wall in cute little planters .|&|Fresh pastries were displayed inside a glass windowed counter and my eye immediately caught a pastry designed in the shape of a flower .|&|It turned out to be an apple tart ... ummm yes , please !|&|It tasted just as delightful as it looked .|&|Not too sweet , flakey , flavorful , and delicious .|&|Each flower petal had a small slice of apple in it .|&|Turns out , it was just baked an hour and a half before we got there .|&|I could eat 5 of them !|&|Luckily I did n't : ) I also ordered a cold brew coffee with vanilla sweetener and a splash of cream .|&|They offer a full service coffee bar so you can definitely get your caffeine on here .|&|I did n't order any other food but they do offer lunch and their specials were displayed on a little board next to the checkout counter .|&|Employees were super friendly and after inquiring , I learned they 've only been open for a few weeks .|&|They seem to do a great job baking everything fresh .|&|I overheard them talking about some of their pastry ideas and my mouth began watering just hearing about them .|&|I will definitely return the next time I am in this area !
Had a great experience here .|&|The owners were a super sweet couple !|&|Needed the curtains that came with my new house cleaned in a short turnaround time .|&|The previous home owners had several pets and when my daughter discovered the curtains and began playing in them it was not a good situation : lots of dust + cat and dog hair + baby = no bueno !|&|Owners completely accommodated my request and were able to clean several sets of curtains within 24-hrs for a slight up charge .|&|It was pricy but that 's what 's to be expected since this was a big job and something that does n't need to be done very often .|&|One of the only local cleaners I was able to find that still cleans curtains and in a short turnaround time at that !|&|Upon pick up , since my daughter was asleep in the car and I had prepaid , I called ahead and they brought them out to my car .|&|Now that 's service !|&|Prevented me from having to haul her in with the carrier and attempt to juggle mounds of curtains and a heavy baby in carrier # mommyproblems .|&|I will totally return to this place the next time I need any dry cleaning ! !|&|I support this business !
Probably the best blueberry muffin I 've ever had !|&|Flavor/texture was perfect and it was n't too sweet like most places make them .|&|The barista was super friendly , patient , and helpful .|&|Coffee was rich and flavorful .|&|Ca n't wait to go back to try other pastries and some of their other coffee options !
New favorite ! !|&|Great location right off University and Mill .|&|Warm and welcoming ambience and staff .|&|You can tell the owners put a lot of thought into the design , decor , service , menu , and flow of the restaurant .|&|Both indoor and outdoor patio seating available .|&|In case there is a wait , there are comfortable seats and a cute little coffee station at the entry .|&|Menu looked delightful and it was tough deciding what to order .|&|Coffee comes with a carafe and they have a bowl of different flavored creamers as well as fancy sugar .|&|They also provide a cold carafe of water for the table .|&|Decided to try the kale tonic and was a little nervous it would be too grainy but it was so incredibly fresh , sweet and flavorful !|&|Definitely a must try !|&|For brunch we ordered the Italian omelet which came with sausage , roasted peppers , tomatoes and some kind of cheese , served with a side of lightly seasoned greens .|&|Also ordered the elevated egg sandwich -- omg it was so fresh and good !|&|It came with a side of seasoned potatoes so it was nice and filling .|&|Kids menu also has some great , affordable options .|&|We went with the fresh egg which came with bacon , toast and a small bowl of fruit- generous for around $ 5.75 .|&|There are n't too many breakfast spots in this part of Tempe so First Watch is an excellent addition and we 'll definitely become regulars at this gem !
Delicious !|&|On a whim , the hubby and I decided to dine here on a Saturday evening .|&|It was late when we arrived ( 9:30pm ) and since they close at 10pm on Saturdays , we were n't sure if they would fit us in and serve us .|&|Not only did they serve us , they did so with a smile and did n't rush us a bit .|&|We had an awesome experience here !|&|Food and service were both outstanding !|&|I was n't super hungry so I ordered the artichokes ( soooo yummy and the sauce was splendid ) and french onion soup ( absolutely delish ) .|&|My husband ordered the fried grouper sandwich and I was n't so sure how it 'd be when he ordered it .|&|Grouper , hmmm ? !|&|I tried a bite and absolutely loved it !|&|I also stole a bunch of his perfectly-fried-to perfection french fries that came served with his sandwich .|&|One more thing I want to be sure to mention .|&|Having worked in the restaurant industry for several years , I know firsthand that at the end of an evening , especially a busy weekend evening , often the kitchen , dining area , and restrooms can looked pretty filthy .|&|On the way to the restroom , you actually pass a portion of the kitchen .|&|I was impressed with how clean and orderly both the kitchen and the restrooms were even at the end of a busy night .|&|Always makes me feel better when I see that a restaurant is clean !|&|Before coming here , I had never heard of Common Ground Culinary , a local restaurant group that owns Twisted Grove Parlor along with several other restaurants .|&|Now that I had such an awesome experience here , I ca n't wait to try some of their other spots !
Outstanding service !|&|Warm greeting from the hostesses and our server was extremely friendly and attentive throughout our entire experience .|&|She did a great making us feel special and went out of her way to engage with our baby too .|&|Food was delicious !|&|We came during lunch and got the combo to split .|&|It came with a side and there are several to chose from .|&|The combo was plenty for two people- especially with a side salad or appetizer .|&|Loved the cornbread which was served warm with butter ... yummm !|&|The ribs were my favorite meat but all were tasty , tender , and flavorful .|&|Such a nice touch that they fry fresh mini donuts at the front and give you a few in a bag upon checking out .|&|We 'll definitely return !|&|Great dining experience .
Camden Sotelo is an awesome property with a friendly , attentive , outstanding staff !|&|The buildings are constructed very well and I love the property layout .|&|Despite being so close to the airport ( which is very convenient if you plan to have lots of out-of-town visitors like us ) we NEVER hear the airplanes inside our apartment .|&|The property is just big enough but also not so large that it feels like a maize .|&|I believe units were originally designed as condos but during the housing market crash they were transformed into apartments - therefore , the floor plans are very well thought out and practical .|&|The provided underground parking garage and security of the complex are also great .|&|You get TWO parking spots ( unheard of in most apartment complexes ) which is practical if you plan to have two people with cars living in the unit .|&|We moved from a 2200 square foot home out-of-state to a 1480 square foot unit in Camden Sotelo and have not missed our large house once !|&|You simply ca n't beat the location of Camden Sotelo !|&|There 's a cute park across the street , a larger park around the corner with a playground and basketball courts , and access to Tempe lake a few blocks away .|&|It 's also situated near Papago Mountain/Park , the Phoenix Zoo , and Desert Botanical Gardens .|&|Across the bridge and you 're in the heart of downtown Tempe on Mill Street and it 's only a 8-10 minute drive to downtown Scottsdale .|&|It 's also situated right off of the 202 highway which is very convenient .|&|We were nervous that with this property being so close to ASU , it would be filled with students and a college/party zone .|&|Although I 'm sure there are some students living here , we have n't had any issues and it seems like most residents are young adults/families .|&|Everyone is friendly and it has a nice community feel to it .|&|Our experiences with all staff have been great and they are friendly , approachable , and professional .|&|Anytime I 've made a request it 's been processed within 24-hours .|&|We LOVE Camden Sotelo and it 's definitely a property to check out !
By far , the coolest , most unique bar I 've ever experienced !|&|UnderTow literally sits in a small room underneath Sip Beer and Coffee .|&|It appears both Sip and UnderTow are in a converted oil change shop .|&|The old shop 's garage doors are used to allow open air seating upstairs in Sip .|&|From the street you can not see UnderTow and you must literally walk through Sip , head down the narrow staircase to reach this hidden gem of a bar .|&|It 's ingenious they decided to convert the underground area where oil change workers access the undercarriage of your car , into this crazy , creative scene from an old pirate 's ship .|&|From previous reviews I knew this place was small and only seats about 20 people .|&|Yet I was still shocked upon walking downstairs just how small and intimate the place really was .|&|Reservations can only be made online up until 4pm the day-of but walk-ins are accepted on a first-come first-serve basis .|&|We could n't get a reservation online as they were already fully booked but we decided to take a shot and show up around 10:30pm on a Saturday .|&|They were actually able to seat the two of us right away .|&|I would caution folks with larger parties that the wait could be longer due to the limited space .|&|Drinks were out of this world and my `` Mock-tail '' was handcrafted by the bartender to make me feel special so I had a tropical drink too .|&|My husband loved his fruity drink , said it was outstanding , and would get it again .|&|If you 're looking for a unique , intimate experience and you 're intrigued by pirates ships , this is your spot !
Believe the hype !|&|This place is legit .|&|Food is amazing , customer service is awesome .|&|I think every worker spoke to and checked on my husband and I at some point during our dining experience .|&|But not in an annoying , leave us alone way ; they all seemed to sincerely care that we were enjoying our meal and overall experience .|&|You know it 's good when the hours are Tuesday-Saturday 11-4 or until food is sold out !|&|My husband 's ribs literally fell off the bones .|&|My pulled pork and brisket were perfect .|&|Their three sauces were great but the meat was so flavorful you did n't even need them .|&|All the side dishes we tried ( coleslaw , jalape√±o grits , and beans ) were delicious .|&|Portions were great and filling .|&|Definitely a must try spot !|&|We 'll be returning and bringing our out of town friends with us .
Wowza !|&|Stumbled upon this new spot last weekend and decided to come check it out this wknd .|&|Man , this is our new go-to for sushi in Old Town !|&|Ambience - super nice , clean , and they have both indoor and outdoor patio seating .|&|Decorative pink flower blossoms on the ceiling and a cool scenic mural on the back wall .|&|Service - outstanding !|&|We were the only customers until right before we left when another couple dined in .|&|The three employees were all very attentive and went out of their way to ensure we had a great dining experience .|&|Food - superb !|&|I ordered a hot green tea and it was made fresh and had some sort of wonderful flavoring .|&|It was probably the best green tea I 've ever had at an Asian restaurant .|&|The miso soup was warm and comforting .|&|Crab rangoon appetizer was made with fresh crabmeat/cream cheese and the dipping sauce was flavorful .|&|For sushi , we tried a Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Godzilla Roll .|&|Both were excellent !|&|We had every intention to order more but both rolls were so massive we were completely stuffed !|&|The sushi chef gave us a sample of his specialty pickled , spiced jalape√±o salad mix and it was sooo good !|&|When I explained I was pregnant and could n't eat any raw fish he was really understanding and said he could cook and prepare any fish the way I 'd like it .|&|He made sure to take his time and you could tell he really put some love into our dishes Quite impressed with this spot and I will definitely be back soon !
Wonderful !|&|All the reviews are legit ! !|&|Perfect place for a date or to celebrate an anniversary , bday or any other special occasion .|&|Or just come to simply enjoy their pretty patio and delicious food .|&|My husband and I came here for a day date on a Friday afternoon and arrived just in time to enjoy their lunch menu .|&|Excellent service and the food was spectacular .|&|Great portions too .|&|Seemed like they just added a few new menu items but also keep some favorites for returning customers .|&|We will definitely be back soon !
New favorite spot !|&|Ca n't wait to bring my husband here because he 's going to love it ! !|&|Came here with my mom and we both fell in love with this place .|&|Our entire dining experience was fabulous from start to finish .|&|Let 's begin with dessert - - because who does n't love dessert ? ! ?|&|We split the beignets and they were to die for !|&|We were literally `` oohing '' and `` ahhing '' as we devoured them .|&|When you take a bite , lo and behold you encounter perfectly caramelized bananas foster .|&|Paired with the crispy dough of the beignet it 's spectacular .|&|My mouth is watering just thinking about them .|&|As if that is n't enough , they serve them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream .|&|AND the portion is huge -- they tempt you with not one , not two , not three , but FOUR large beignets !|&|This is a dish that four people could split .|&|Well , the two of us tore them up and ate all four .|&|( They would n't be good as leftovers ... or at least that 's what we told ourselves . )|&|We must 've been hungry or tempted by their menu because we still made it to dessert despite splitting several appetizers and sharing an entree .|&|Let 's talk appetizers .|&|Stuffed mushrooms -- so good I was dipping the bread they served them with in the butter , garlic sauce .|&|Fried green tomatoes with guacamole - win ; plus , who can pass on that amazing combo .|&|Duck fries - super yummy and the sauce they came with was awesome .|&|After all that , we split the beef shoulder entree .|&|It was so soft , tender and the mashed potatoes and roasted root vegetables were perfect .|&|Food and service alone were five stars .|&|I also love the decor because everything is tastefully themed with pigs ( `` sow '' ) .|&|Even the restrooms have cute decals , one with a pig in red heels and one with a boar .|&|I had such a great dining experience here !|&|Next time , I ca n't wait to try their award winning deviled eggs .|&|I 'll be sure to leave room for dessert again !
Awesome breakfast spot .|&|My new fav !|&|Everything including service was wonderful .|&|Definitely recommend their pancakes .|&|The berry pancake came w so much fresh fruit ! !|&|The cinnamon pancake was like a Cinnabon Loved the spinach , bacon and Monterey Jack scramble ! !|&|Cheese grits were so creamy .|&|It 's nice you can substitute your side for a pancake .|&|Will be coming back again real soon !
This place has a great ambience .|&|They even have a DJ during busy weekend brunch hours .|&|Extra bonus- strong , flavorful coffee !|&|Although we did n't try it , they have an extensive , impressive Bloody Mary bar .|&|Husband tried the house sangria and said it was the perfect blend of sweet and strong .|&|In terms of food , so many delicious looking options .|&|If you like seafood try their lump crab frittata or lump crab sweet potato hash -- both were excellent .|&|We also split a 1/2 order of apple pie pancakes and they were delicious .|&|A 1/2 order comes with two large pancakes and is plenty , especially if you just want a taste of sweet along with your full savory meal .|&|If you 're looking for a fun brunch environment this is your spot .|&|Do expect a wait during the busy brunch hours .
Great food and service .|&|The Hawaiian ribeye is worth the price .|&|And the steak salad was just perfect- I can still taste the perfect balance of flavors .|&|Yummmm !|&|Will definitely return !|&|!
This place is legit and hip .|&|Coffee AND beer ? !|&|Win !|&|Live music .|&|Good food .|&|Great patio seating .|&|Plus it 's located in a great spot near the heart of Old Town with a small parking lot of its own .|&|What more could you ask for ?|&|This is a great spot to come to during the day if you need to get work done but want a cool environment to get inspired .|&|Often in the evenings they have live music .|&|Baristas are knowledgable and make all their coffee drinks from scratch .|&|Food is fresh .|&|Decent prices .|&|Love this spot !|&|Nuff said .
My favorite ! !|&|Everything I 've ever had is just wonderful and so fresh .|&|Some of my favorites- grains and greens salad , flying avocado wrap , Mother Earth bowl ( add salmon for protein ) .|&|Good portions .|&|Love their fresh , flavored lemonades at the beverage station that you can mix and together .|&|Fruit infused water is a nice touch .|&|Tends to get busy for lunch but they do a great job of organizing the crowds and tables .|&|Prices are n't cheap but quality of food is so worth it .|&|I would come here every day if I court afford it !
I was more than a little surprised when my adventure partner told me we would be picking up dinner at a place called Sam 's Sun Sandwich in Carrick .|&|I immediately web searched Sam 's to make sure it met my approval , and I am so glad I was n't a picky bitch that day !|&|A sunny day , plus Sam 's sunny disposition , plus perfect Mid-Eastern cuisine , plus no picky bitch equals a perfect day ( there was also handfuls of black raspberries , eagles , successful mushroom foraging and swimming ) !|&|We tried Sam 's Baba Ghannouj - which was an ideal combination of smoky , oily and creamy , the veggie grape leaves - which were uniquely spiced and definitely not the ones from the can you get just about everywhere else , and the spinach pie - which was the best fucking spinach pie ever ; it had a really tasty dough , not phyllo , but more like that of a calzone and the filling was definitely made from fresh , not frozen , spinach with just a hint of lemony tang .|&|Sam also brought us a sample of his falafel which was probably , as another reviewer mentioned , the best in the Pittsburgh region .|&|All other patrons we witnessed coming and going seemed to be regulars of this very friendly and most worthy establishment .
USPS , FedEx and UPS services all in one place !|&|They 'll even do the packing for you , if needed .|&|Super convenient and waaay more pleasant than the East Liberty Post Office .|&|I often leave with a feeling of nostalgia for old fashioned family business ' , something I 'll never get from the kids at the FedEx counter .|&|Even so , I would n't go out of my way to spend extra to ship from A & A , but it 's great when you 're in the neighborhood and/or need to ship from multiple carriers .|&|And it 's usually a quick stop .|&|They 've even come to pick up some unwieldy boxes from my workplace to send out .|&|A+ !
Lili is a new fave for my `` caffeinated lunch '' fix .|&|Great little selection of sandwiches - I love the vegan Banh Mi ( ! )|&|and the tempeh reuben is good too .|&|Sandwiches come with pickles on the side ; major plus !|&|They play excellent music ( I would n't expect anything less with Mind Cure up above to curate the selections ) and the shop is generally hip , but not in an exclusive way .|&|Rather , it exudes a rad community vibe that you will either want to be a part of or feel repelled by because of your inability to feel comfortable in a genuinely cool place .|&|Disclaimer : nobody is going to befriend you just for walking in the door and you might get a sunburn if you sit on the patio on a sunny day .
just another 5 star review ... yawn ... stretch ... order another shot .|&|espresso a mano is one of few places in town where the baristas are capable of not fucking up soy milk in the steaming process .|&|bonus , a heart AND a feather on the same head !|&|i am tickled with love .|&|plus , they carry a coconut chai tea , which is uniquely delicious , and some interesting chocolates .|&|they 're so cool , they do n't even capitalize their name .
It took me awhile to get here because I thought it would not be vegan friendly - BUT I finally made it and the veggie sandwich is amazingly good !|&|I also got a small salad which was perfectly fresh and delicious , though unnecessary because the sandwich was huge .|&|I really love all the sauces they have available , too .|&|The service really takes Gaucho Parilla over the top - so so so genuinely enthusiastic and friendly !|&|The space is rustically cozy and the sandwiches are a bit messy ; all part of the fun .|&|Yep , this place is fun !
Udipi is definitely worth the trip off of the beaten path .|&|If getting off the beaten path is not enough of an excuse for you , let me be the eleventh to tell you how great the food is : Udipi serves some of the best cuisine I 've ever had the pleasure to taste .|&|The samosas are near perfect and served with hari ( green ) and meethhi ( tamarind ) chutneys that must be blessed by Annapurna , as I can offer no other explanation as to why they were so much better than your typical Indian condiment offerings .|&|Aloo Gobi and Baingan Bartha are two of my favorite dishes and though it is hard for me to stray , I am eager to try other things on the menu .|&|I believe that Udipi takes great care in preparing food , as if it all should be fit for prasada .|&|Eat like a deva but accept your fate of eternal samsara , as the kama of dining at Udipi will keep you coming back for more .|&|Notes on the service : The service was just as service should be -- just plain service .|&|Our main server had a most pleasant smile .|&|They leave a pitcher of water for you at the table , so that you may refill as needed ( I like that ) .|&|There were several children dining in the restaurant while we were there with whom the employees established very friendly rapport .|&|My apologies for any inaccurate allusions to Hinduism .
Oooooh , just ate here yesterday and can not wait to go back !|&|Two of us shared the vegetable momo and ordered the Nepali vegetable dish and the Indian vegetable curry .|&|The momo dumplings were the kind of chewy that I love , with a delicately spiced filling and a most amazing dipping sauce .|&|The sauce was pretty spicy ( I detected what I believe to be habanero , yum ! )|&|and it did overcome the aromatic quality of the momo , but it was soooo magical , I would be happy to put it on anything , all of the time !|&|And I was in luck , because more came with the entrees !|&|The Nepali vegetables and the Indian curry were the exact same dish - we did n't mind only because it was especially delicious ; appropriately spicy ( this time more like chili and/or cayenne ) , not heavy or oily and decidedly savory ( not sweet like some Asian styles ) with freshly cooked broccoli , cauliflower , carrots and potatoes .|&|One of the veggie dishes ( not sure if it was the Nepali or the Indian - again they were the same dish ) , came on a thali style platter with homemade pickles ( mild ) , a little mix of greens and garlic , an *extremely* tasty dal , plus my new favorite condiment .|&|And rice , both entrees came with rice - nothing too remarkable about that , but the rice did seem to have been cooked in a broth , maybe with a little butter ( I 'm not a fan of that latter bit , but I feel that it indicates particular care in the preparation ) .|&|I really , really look forward to returning to Subba ( wish it was closer to me ) .
My experience with Clearview has gotten even better with the mobile app - now featuring mobile deposits ! ! !|&|I no longer have to worry about getting my checks to the bank ; I can deposit them from anywhere , anytime .|&|Best thing to happen in my personal-banking life !|&|I sincerely recommend this credit union for anybody in western PA seeking honest , professional and efficient banking ( see my previous review for more reasons ) .
Chris , owner and laborer of Immaculate Auto Detailing , was the lucky man to scrub 4 years worth of filth out of my car .|&|The business is appropriately named , as my car left his shop in a state of immaculate cleanliness , with absolutely no details overlooked .|&|I was really amazed with the results .|&|It looks like new ! ! !|&|Chris gave us a ride to the mall while we waited for him to work his magic , which was a nice gesture .|&|He was a super nice guy .|&|We were able to laugh comfortably about the forgotten porn in my trunk and used condoms under the seats .|&|There 's no need to be embarrassed about your habits with Chris , he 's seen it all and he does not make judgements - he just does a really fucking great job , and he takes pride in his work .|&|He had another job waiting , but instead of rushing us out , he made friendly conversation and helped us with directions to our next destination .|&|When I called to make my appointment , he was pretty well booked up , so I ended up with an appointment about a month after the call .|&|It was worth the wait .
I think that Shanna M. and Jeska D. quite sufficiently covered this small wonder .|&|I sampled four of Embury 's current drink specials , and will add that each one was uniquely excellent .|&|The bartender was particularly skilled and informative , as well as looked the part , old-timey .|&|Since I do not know of anywhere else in Pittsburgh to get a cheaper connoisseur 's beverage , I must say that the prices were right on the money , well , spent .
I did n't quite realize how much I love Thai Cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel .|&|Their absence was deeply felt .|&|Now that they are back in action , the restaurant is better than ever !|&|It is now fully handicapped accessible , with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls .|&|I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel , but no , they are the same .|&|The food , also same , if not improved .|&|The Tom Kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious .|&|They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy .|&|Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan ( just ask about egg - veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste ) .|&|And the service has always been excellent .
Penhollows always has a neat selection of tempting things .|&|They seem to cater to a variety of budgets and styles , so I find it difficult not to find great gifts here .|&|It 's also not an overwhelmingly large store ; they 're all about quality , not quantity .|&|I ca n't stand sifting through a bunch of crap to find a gift , so in this way Penhollows and I are right for each other .|&|I have no experience with their interior design service but I imagine from the items in the store that they have excellent taste and can adapt to a variety of customers !
Mark & Mike rock !|&|They give great service for a great price & will be our go-to guys whenever we 're in Vegas .|&|Certified RV technicians and entrepreneurs ; a great combination .
Not normally a 25 % tipper but Brio got mine on 4/20/12 !|&|Great food , great service , and great experience as well .|&|It was Friday night and the place was SLAMMED , 45 minute wait for a table .|&|Wife and I decided to sit at the bar and try the house cocktails while we waited .|&|Ended up staying at the bar where we enjoyed the company of the staff , full food service , and GREAT food !|&|We shared the risotto and it was magnificent !|&|Reminded me of the risotto I 'd enjoyed in Northern Italy .|&|Definitely recommend dining at Brio Tuscan Grille if you 're on the Strip in Las Vegas !
I have been a customer of Car Tech for a dew years now , I first met Charlie the owner through the Veterans organization I work at .|&|He contacted us to ask if we could send him a veteran a month so he could service their car for free as a way to thank them for their service .|&|What a generous offer I have sent a lot of vets to him .|&|He services our company truck for us and he works on my car as well .|&|Work is always completed quickly and the price is always what he quotes .|&|I have found him to be a very honest person which is impossible to find in an auto repair shop .|&|Highly recommend them !|&|David Wimmer Veterans for Veterans
If you 're looking for a change of pace and something to do in Vegas besides gamble , check out the Neon Museum Boneyard Park !|&|It features old Vegas signs that have been rescued from being thrown away forever .|&|These signs really are relics of the past and contain a lot of history within them .|&|You have to book your tour in advance online ( http : //neonmuseum.org ) and you can also purchase your tickets there .|&|Our guide was Ian , and he was funny and knowledgeable about the various signs , and gave us some insight into Las Vegas history .|&|Everyone seemed very happy to be on the tour , and it was a good vibe amongst the group .|&|It 's close enough to the downtown area , I could have probably walked it .|&|This was my second time on the tour , and they did rotate some of the signs in and out of the tour , so I did n't hear and see all the same things twice .|&|It felt neat to see the old signs and hear about the level of work that went into them , and the stories about how things used to be in Vegas .|&|The tour lasted about an hour .|&|We were allowed to take photos as we went along .|&|All participants of the tour signed a waiver before entering , saying we would not use our photos for commercial purposes .|&|It 's a great tour , and definitely something different to do in Vegas .
Took a drive out to Rhyolite this past week during my stay in Vegas .|&|It was about 115 miles each way , and made for a good day trip ( and alternative to feeding my money into the slot machines ) .|&|Rhyolite is over a hundred years old , and it 's an honest-to-God ghost town which makes it both a solemn and exciting experience .|&|Stop at the bottle house first , and grab a pamphlet so you can give yourself a self-guided tour .|&|There 's also a guest book you can sign .|&|Restrooms are located further up the road .|&|There are two , and they are porta-potty style , but enclosed in a small building .|&|There were signs warning about rattlesnakes , so be wary when walking around .|&|While you could drive up along the main road and never get out of your car , most people found a place to park and walked around to get the full effect .|&|Amongst the mountain backdrop , are the remains of some of the old town 's main business buildings .|&|They have signs posted out front indicating what you are looking at .|&|The buildings are pretty well preserved considering the fact they are over a century old .|&|Also , I was impressed that there was no vandalism !|&|The area is kept pretty clear of trash and there are some backroads that lead to an old house , jail , and a grave site .|&|Photo enthusiasts will find a lot of things to keep them happy .|&|Most of the buildings are behind some kind of fence , or wire , but you can get pretty close and take great pictures .|&|There is definitely a feeling of the past when you 're there .|&|It felt a bit sacred to me , to walk through and imagine the people who had lived there and the high hopes they had before they had to leave .|&|Rhyolite is just 4 miles outside of Beatty .|&|If you kept going , you could probably go to Death Valley National Park ( I hope to go next time ) .|&|Also , along the road to Rhyolite you will pass the Goldwell Open Air Museum , which you should definitely check out since it 's very cool and somewhat eccentric , and also , right there .
We stopped by the House of 1000 Beers one afternoon after visiting Deer Lakes Park , as it had been suggested to us before by a friend .|&|My husband is a huge beer advocate so the name itself sold him , ha !|&|We sat out of the small deck which was pleasant .|&|We were up high enough that being close to the road really did n't bother us at all- infact we barely noticed it .|&|We each ordered a beer off their menu , which they serve in , I believe , 4 oz pours.. so you can leave plenty of room to try lots !|&|I ordered a small pizza.. which was huge .|&|It was so so good , but it was HUGE .|&|My husband ordered the wings which come in 1 flavor , but they were really good .|&|Sometimes I question places that dont give you a flavor option for things like wings , but they honestly dont need more than 1 here .|&|Our server was really nice and she was everything you 'd expect of a server - attentive , prompt , thorough - the works .|&|We were the only people there eating when we arrived , although more had come throughout the hour or so we were there , but regardless , she was very good .|&|I have no doubt we 'll return to the House of 1,000 Beers the next time we 're out that way !
Do n't let the exterior discourage you from trying this place ( we almost did ! ) .|&|When you approach the building , you may start to question your decision making abilities , but trust me , keep going !|&|We were really skeptical.. like , REALLY skeptical !|&|Against our better judgement , we proceeded , and even after a couple of minutes were unsure if we 'd stay.. but we are so glad that we did !|&|What began as a very questionable choice for a night out , ended up being a BLAST !|&|And somehow , 2 and a half hours after we hesitantly entered the Kbox , we were still there having so much fun and singing ourselves stupid .|&|The prices are somewhat high I think , but the drinks are cheap and considering how much fun we had , it was so worth it !|&|The setting is an old house or apartment building , with each room turned into your own personal little karaoke studio .|&|There are couches , tables , tamberines , and then of course the karaoke equipment .|&|It 's definitely a diamond in the rough , and if you can convince yourself and your friends to go in and stay for at least 15 or 20 minutes , you wo n't be disappointed !
Awesome Wings - check .|&|Amazing coal fired pizza - double check .|&|Great Service - check .|&|Needless to say , we love Anthony 's !|&|This is our go to when we decide to eat out last minute and have a craving for something filling and familiar .|&|We love the wings , and regardless of the serving sizes , we always each get our own pizza , because who does n't love left overs ? ?|&|Everytime we 've been here we 've had a great time , with the exception of the last time .|&|I did n't let it effect my rating or my review , because I know it 's not typical , but I still think it 's important to mention .|&|We were sitting at a high top table right across from the kitchen area , with servers constantly rushing by and in perfect ear shot of all of their conversations , which I do n't normally care about , with the exception of this time .|&|There was one male server who was obviously flustered and irritated , and when he saw he had been given another table , this was his response- `` G*d d*mn it , do I not deserve a f*cking break , J*sus Chr*st ! ''|&|... ... ... .. not cool , dude , not cool .|&|Fortunately he was not our server , or we would have been out the door at that moment .|&|Our server was good ( seemingly new , but good ) , and otherwise we had a good time , but that was a pretty shocking experience .|&|I get that you 're tired , but maybe just do n't be an immature idiot next time , and be aware of your surroundings .|&|ANYYYWAYYY !|&|That aside , we love eating and drinking here and will continue frequenting !|&|Hopefully that one server does n't get too many tables again , after all , we would n't want him to make too much money off of those pesky paying customers that are such an inconvenience !
Have returned to Toss't a few times since my original review , and I 'm hooked : ) Everytime I 've eaten here it 's been amazing , and I may be guilty for the addiction of my co-workers as well .|&|So good !|&|The last couple of times I 've been there I 've ordered a custom salad with the amazing ginger dressing I mentioned in my review , and I am so in love .|&|Do yourself a favor and go there .|&|go now !
What an amazing gem !|&|Narcisi has certainly perfectly the concept of a winery/gathering place , and do n't be surprised if you end up staying for hours !|&|The grounds are beautiful , with the perfect amount of Italian theming , it 's a warm , welcoming atmosphere that draws you in and insists that you stay .|&|The first thing you come to is the host stand for the restaurant , which offers a beautiful , outdoor seating area situated in what is made to look like an Italian vineyard , and a delicious menu that satisfies almost every taste ( we opted for the bruschetta , and it was delicious ! ) .|&|If you step inside the front door , you 're immediately welcomed by the wine tasting counter , and continue to the left you 'll find a wonderful gift shop , where you can buy not just memorabilia and bottles of wine , but also homemade jellies , spreads , and other similar findings !|&|If you decide that staying outside sounds more appealing , Narcisi offers tons if `` picnic '' space that 's open to the public .|&|They 're only requirement ?|&|You just have to purchase a bottle of wine !|&|You can bring your kids , your own food , a blanket , the pets.. whatever !|&|There 's a pavilion area with lots of picnic tables , and a large grassy area as well .|&|You 'll find a small creek that runs through the back of the property where you 're also welcome to spend time .|&|The wine is fantastic , the setting is perfect , and the staff is delightful .|&|They 've got it all figured out , and I personally ca n't wait to return !
We had a great time at MacDonalds Ranch !|&|I was looking for something fun and specific to the area to do with my husband and my in-laws while we were in Scottsdale , and while there 's plenty of fun things to do , I was somewhat limited because my in-laws are n't quite as adventurous as my husband and I , so when I found this deal on Groupon I immediately contacted the ranch via email to ask some questions .|&|They replied promptly and were very informative - that was extremely appreciated !|&|I concern was that many of the reviews were regarding families with kids , or for a different season , so I wanted to make sure this would be fun for 4 adults as well.. if you 're wondering the same thing , I 'll save you some time and just tell you that it was perfect for us !|&|I purchased the 90 minute ride for 4 people ( less than $ 150 !|&|) , there were 2 other adults in our group ( there may be up to 10 people ) and we had a really good time !|&|The ride was easy , so it 's perfect for beginners .|&|My mother in law is not comfortable around animals ( not something you usually want to find out AFTER the fact , but oh well haha ! )|&|and she did great !|&|Her horse was gentle and they tail-to-nose the entire time , at a slow , easy pace .|&|Truthfully , if you have a lot of experience riding , this may not be your choice activity , as it is a `` perfect for beginners and kids '' activity.. so just keep that in mind !|&|The guides were really friendly and very eager to answer any and all questions we had throughout the entire ride .|&|There was a guide in the front and a guide in the back , to make sure nobody gets too far behind .|&|During our ride we saw a coyote which I thought was awesome !|&|We chose the sunset ride ( end of June ) so it was really very beautiful and peaceful .|&|Another thing I really appreciated was that after we were all saddled up , they took one of our phones and took a couple pictures of us on our horses , and then took pictures of us riding which were available for purchase ( $ 10 per photo ) , and we purchased all of them !|&|It was a really great keepsake that was n't over priced !|&|This was our first time partaking in anything like this , so while I do n't have anything to compare it to , I can tell you that I ca n't imagine how it could get too much better.. and all the locals we spoke to about it agreed that MacDonalds Ranch is a great place to visit !|&|I highly suggest going - fun for all ages and a great time !
I like this gym , and for what it is , id say it definitely deserves 5 stars .|&|Plenty of equipment to use and it 's all seemingly in good condition .|&|The locker rooms are spacious with plenty of your typical amenities .|&|They offer group fitness classes , training , tanning and hydro massage tables with their upper level memberships , which is really nice ... some of their similar competetors offer the same memberships prices with less offerings .|&|For what its worth , Crunch Fitness is , i think , best in class : )
I cant believe I 'm the first to review this tattoo studio ( I also cant believe its taken me so long to do so.. oops ) .|&|I got my tattoo here last month by Amy , and I could n't have been more pleased with my experience , which is a pretty big deal when you 're dealing with something as permanent as a tattoo.. not like I can just demand a refund if I 'm unhappy .|&|From my very first time there to make my appointment , I was impressed by what I saw and experienced .|&|First and foremost , the studio is clean and organized.. BIG deal .|&|Amy is super cool and friendly , and she literally may be the easiest person to work with .|&|I had to cancel my original appointment and reschedule it for a later time , and she was nothing but understanding and nice about it .|&|They do require a small deposit when you book an appointment , but they 're really flexible about it .|&|The day of my appointment , Amy opened the shop early to do my tattoo , which was super cool of her .|&|She took time before hand to perfect my idea and make sure it was exactly what I wanted , and really helped ease my nerves as we stood there and talked.. she 's got a great personality !|&|More importantly though , shes a fantastic artist !|&|My tattoo was simple and quick , but I chose her and her studio because I had seen her work online and was really impressed with her stuff , so I knew that even with something as simple as mine , she 'd nail it , and she did .|&|I 'm totally inlove with it , and I 'd recommend her to anyone , anytime !
Everytime I visit Dibellas I have a flawless experience .|&|No matter what time of day , how busy , who 's working , I always get great service and great food .|&|My go to sub is the God Father , hot , on white bread with lettuce tomatoes provolone cheese and oil.. and of course that chocolate chip cookie .|&|When you walk in you 're facing a long dining area/ordering line , which can be a little concerning when it 's jammed with people and the lines out the door , but their staff is prompt and efficient , and although sometimes they lack the personality to go with their great service , I 'd rather have quick , quality food than a chatty , overly friendly employee- after all , that 's not what 's going to satisfy my hunger .|&|And besides , when you 're working on getting people in and out and concentrating on orders with no end in sight , I 'd say it 's expected to feel a little less chatty , and I 'm ok with that !|&|Continue to deliver quick service and great food , and I 'll continue coming back .
Ok , I have to admit it.. this place is fun !|&|It 's kind of like a low-key , less expensive Dave and Busters , but truthfully I had more fun here than I ever have at a D & B !|&|We decided to stop in because it was my younger brothers 14th birthday and as many times as we had driven by on our way to and from Pittsburgh Mills , we finally had a reason to check it out !|&|It was about 8pm on a Tuesday evening and when we walked in , there was a small crowd ( mainly families and teens ) with plenty of space to spread out .|&|The bowling lanes are really nice and all of the equipment is new and in good working order .|&|The bowling is updated and modern , and while you have all the classic fun of bowling , they 've adapted to the times and spiced it up a bit ( some bowling alleys have done this and some havent.. but this is the nicest we 've seen and been to recently ) .|&|They provide you with that fun , `` cosmic bowling '' -ish atmosphere , without having to stay out late or wait til the weekend .|&|There 's a full bar and a full food menu as well .|&|The games are set up D & B style , where you load money onto a card and use that to play games ( they do n't charge for purchase of the card , btw ! ) .|&|They also offer bumper cars and laser tag , the latter of which we took full advantage of !|&|We played 2 games of bowling ( $ 25 for an hour per lane , including shoes.. not bad considering there were 3 of us ) , and then we played 2 games of laser tag ( $ 10/ 15 min game for 2 games , $ 7 for 1 game ) .|&|We had an absolute blast with the laser tag !|&|I 've never played before , but of course my 2 male counterparts were practically pros haha.. all 3 of us were sweating after the first game and needed a break because we played so hard lol !|&|Now I do n't have anything to compare it to , but it seemed pretty big to me !|&|Lots of good equipment to choose from , clever theming , and thoughtful design/lay out !|&|My 14 year old brother had a blast , as did my husband and I ( in fact I 'd say it 's safe to say we had just as much fun as the kid ! ) .|&|We will definitely go back , with or without a teenager lol.. we liked the bowling alley more than any we 've been to , and the games are an added bonus !|&|What a fun way to spend a Tuesday night !|&|I would definitely recommend Zone 28 to anyone looking for a fun place to go , regardless if your age or the reason.. the prices are just right and you 'll have an great time.. what more could you ask for ?
The most important part of this review can be summed up on 2 words- DOG .|&|FRIENDLY .|&|Really awesome little local brewery right on the North Side !|&|There 's a big parking lot right next door and although they dont serve food , there are restaurants within walking distance and occasionally they do have a food truck parked outside !|&|And it 's ok that they do n't serve food because that means you can enjoy a nice brewsky with your best friend sitting right beside you ( I 'm referring to your dog , of course ) !|&|And when I say they 're dog friendly , I mean that whole heartedly..|&|They honestly LOVE dogs and want you to bring them !|&|Second most important piece of information is that they really do have great beer !|&|They offer flights so you can taste more than 1 before making your decision , and I love that they also offer a size that 's smaller than a pint , for those of us who like beer but maybe ca n't properly handle it in larger ( normal ) serving sizes ; ) The inside is small but really cool , and when the weather is nice they open up their garage door so you can sit and mingle outside as well .|&|AND , they even help fundraise for local animal shelters by hosting events and brewing special beers to raise money !|&|Really though , what more could you possibly ask for ?|&|: ) The owners are super nice and the patrons are friendly , so you 'll always feel welcome and I 'm sure you 'll enjoy yourself !
My friend and I decided to go bike riding after work on Friday .|&|She has her own that she rides to work , but I had to rent one , so we walked over to the Golden Triangle Bike Rental .|&|The staff working that day was really helpful and friendly ( the guy even offered to pump up my friends tires for her because they were low..|&|A+ !|&|) , and seemed really knowledgeable about their inventory .|&|With the rental you get a helmet , bike lock , and small bag attached to your bike to store things in ( ie cell phone , ID , keys.. little things ) .|&|The bikes are really good quality and kept in good condition.. you 're not getting some old beat up bike that 's seen better days , you 're getting a new ( er ) , high quality bike , and for $ 8 an hour , you ca n't beat that .|&|I will definitely be going back to rent a bike from here ( until I get my own , of course ! ) ..|&|it 's small and can be tricky to find if you 're not sure of the area , but truthfully it 's a pretty convenient location once you find your way .|&|Biking in Pittsburgh is such a great pastime , whether you do it for leisure , exercise , competitively , or just to try something new , PGH has great trails and is really bike friendly , and of course you cant beat the scenery !
My friend recommended this place to me so I tried it out yesterday with a friend for a pedicure , and I loved it !|&|As soon as you walk in you can see that the place it well kept and clean - BIG plus !|&|It 's very classy but still comfortable , and from what I experienced , the people working there are really nice .|&|The prices are reasonable and I left totally satisfied .|&|The pedicure was great and I genuinely enjoyed myself.. what more can you ask for ?|&|I highly recommend this place , and I 'll definitely be going back for more services !
If you are looking for the PERFECT spot on Mt Washington , or maybe even all of Pittsburgh , this is your place .|&|The view is what drew us there , but the food is what will keep us going back .|&|I can only speak for my own meal , which was the salmon , but I will assure you that THAT is how salmon is supposed to be prepared .|&|It was absolutely phenomenal.. and I 've eaten a lot of salmon- that was by far the best !|&|Everyone else loved their meals as well , and finished every bite .|&|I had a red sangria as my drink and , again , it was perfect .|&|Our service was totally on point , and that paired with our amazing view of our beautiful city could n't have been better .|&|Just a short walk from the top of the Duquesne Incline and the overlook , the location is very convenient and easy to find and get to .|&|There is a parking lot right across the street that is $ 10 to use , but makes it much quicker and easier than searching for street parking .
Last week we chose The Commoner to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary , and the experience we had was one that ca n't be topped .|&|We made our reservations 2 days in advance , and they were for a little later in the evening , around 8:30 .|&|The night of , we ended up having to push our reservation back twice , because well , life happens and you ca n't control the world around you , and it was just one unforeseen circumstance after another.. which was slowly making our night stressful and pretty miserable .|&|But both times I shamefully called to change our dinner time , they were so overly nice and accommodating , and that alone made my night better , and took away some of the tension that we were experiencing trying to get there .|&|When we FINALLY arrived , we were greeted by warm , smiling faces and a personalized welcome that was much appreciated .|&|We were taken right away to our table , and to our surprise , there was a framed picture of my husband and I from our wedding day , and written on the picture said `` Happy Anniversary From Hotel Monaco Pittsburgh '' , along with a personalize card , a bottle of champagne and desert for both of us.. are you kidding me ?|&|We were so blown away by the time and effort that was taken to help us celebrate our anniversary.. it was unbelievable .|&|We were greeted by our server who promptly wished us a Happy Anniversary and poured our champagne , and from there , the service we were given was outstanding .|&|From our server , to the food and drinks , to the staff helping to run food and clear tables , everyone was absolutely incredible .|&|Even without all of the personalized touches , we would have been very happy and impressed with our experience at The Commoner , but when you go so above and beyond to make your guests feel important and welcome , that 's an amazing business .|&|I work for another luxury hotel downtown , and we do these kinds of things for people all of the time , so it was so nice to be on the receiving end and remember just how important these kinds of gestures are .|&|This was our first time even stepping inside of the Hotel Monaco , but I can assure you that we absolutely will be back , whether its for dinner or for a short stay .|&|Thank you to the staff for making our 2nd anniversary so memorable !
Great hotel , great staff , great location !|&|We were only there for 1 night , but had absolutely zero complaints when we left .|&|The staff was friendly and accomodating ( and very knowledgeable about the area ) , everything was clean and in wonderful condition , and you really do n't have to leave the building if you do n't want to .|&|The very bottom floor has shopping , cafes , bars , etc. , and the restaurant and lounge located on the main floor are awesome , too !|&|Did n't get a chance to use the health club or pool , but did go see it and it seemed legit for a hotel .|&|Overall great stay !
Without question , THE BEST sushi I have EVER had ! !|&|The hubs and I stopped in for dinner a couple nights ago , and we ordered 3 rolls to share , and each one was amazing !|&|We usually like one more than another , or maybe do n't quite care for one.. but this night , we loved all 3 .|&|We ordered the Saga Monster Roll , the Rocking Volcano and the Phoenix.. and they were so so good !|&|Our service was good , as well .|&|One thing I love about getting sushi is that you can typically get in and out pretty quick , and this was no exception .|&|We were seated immediately , served promptly , and of course , loved our food !
Tried this place for the first time today and loved it !|&|Definitely up there with some of the best sushi we 've had .|&|Not only was the food good , but the staff was friendly and the place was clean- big plus !|&|Prices were a little high but when it comes to sushi , I 'm willing to spend a little more if it means quality food .|&|And , an added bonus , when he brought us our check , we got a reusable discount card to use with pre5y generous discounts .|&|We 'll definitely be going back.. Maybe try the hibachi next time !
Crave is still our favorite place in the area to go .|&|We take our out of town guests there , we buy gift cards to give as thank you gifts.. we love the atmosphere and most importantly , we love the food !|&|Their bar is big so that 's usually where we sit , and the bartenders are typically really good .|&|It gets pretty busy in there at certain times , so you 're better off to just sit at the bar and let the bartenders take care of you .|&|We love the concept..|&|I mean , what part of GOURMET GRILLED CHEESE does n't sound wonderful ?|&|My favorite is the West Coast BLT , although I 've tried quite a few and none of them have disappointed .|&|They have a soup of the day everyday , and if you 're lucky , it 'll be Stuffed Pepper Soup when you visit ; ) .
Where do I start ? ?|&|i LOVE the East End Food Co-op !|&|One of my colleagues introduced me to the co-op and I was super skeptical , but when I went back by myself I was immediately in love .|&|I originally went the first time to get some essential oils , but left with that and then some !|&|I 've been back quite a few times since then and I ca n't get enough !|&|I get a little overwhelmed when I go in if I dont have a very specific list ( and even then , if you 're not familiar with the products or choices , it can be confusing ) but I do love to go in and just explore..|&|It 's really a little piece of heaven for any health food lover .|&|I love their selections of dairy products and meats as well.. theres also a great supplement section..|&|I could go on and on , but you get it .|&|This place is a diamond in the rough and I love it !
i LOVE sharp edge creekhouse !|&|we are there almost every friday after work , and we 've never been let down .|&|We 've had 1 or 2 minor things go wrong with an order , but it 's not even worth mentioning because it 's always immediately taken care of above and beyond expectation .|&|The food is I would say , just average , but we love going there because they have a great beer selection and we always feel so welcome and taken care of when we show up .|&|The staff is so friendly , and so knowledgable.. these people know their beer !|&|Their late night menu is decent .|&|They have a bunch of half price appetizers , and have a limited selection of full price items as well ( it 's basically the entire menu excluding soups and salads ) .|&|The prices are good and we always leave satisfied : )
A nice occasional change from the usual brueggers right next door .|&|They are always packed when I go in but the service is always quick and accurate .|&|The employees are usually pretty friendly as well , even when they are busy .|&|No complaints here : )
After living in Philly for 2 years and being deprived of my life long sheetz addiction , it would take a massacre for me to rate ANY Sheetz less than 5 stars , so , yes , I 'm probably biased .|&|However , I accept that fact and will continue to love sheetz until I have no love left to give , and this location is no acception .|&|Thanks for supporting my addiction , Sheetz !|&|: )
I happen to love this Starbucks .|&|I 've worked downtown for 2 years now , and this is definitely my favorite location to visit .|&|First of all , it 's super convenient ( for me anyway ) , I pass it everyday on my way to and from work .|&|It 's smaller inside than a lot of other Starbucks ' , but I 'll gladly cram into this store to avoid going to the others .|&|The staff here is always incredibly friendly and helpful .|&|The store is clean and does n't smell ( like some other nearby locations ... ) .
For what it is , I 'd say this is almost as good as it gets !|&|Really great menu , fresh ingredients , and a friendly staff.. we had a great breakfast here !|&|We both ordered off the specials menu , I ordered the Heirloom Tomatoes & Buratta Cheese dish , which was amazing !|&|It 's served on a grain toast with 2 basted eggs on the side , and although it looks small the ingredients make it filling and very yummy !|&|I also ordered the Morning Meditation juice , and while my husband want a fan ( not his taste ) , I thought it was great !|&|We said we 'd have to go back before our vacation ended because there were so many things on the menu thar we wanted to try !
This has very quickly become my favorite Asian restaurant around !|&|I 've never dined in , always ordered carry out , and they 're so quick and my food has always been perfect !|&|And almost everytime I go , there are at least 2 or 3 other people there picking up orders as well..|&|Apparently my opinions are shared !|&|I LOVE that they offer such an extensive sushi menu ! !|&|My husband can get his typical `` Chinese food '' fix , while I 'm able to have my beloved sushi.. and it 's really good !|&|My favorite is the Crunchy roll.. soooo good !
this place .|&|this place is just.. well its just awesome .|&|went there for the first time a couple weeks ago and i 'm sorry that i 'm just now writing this review , because i ca n't remember the name of the bartender , but let me tell you about what i DO remember - this guy was incredible .|&|he honestly made our experience unforgettable and because of him , we will most definitely be going back .|&|I didnt eat any food , but the 2 people i were with got pizzas , and they seemed to enjoy them .|&|then of course , there 's the beer .|&|now , i 'm not a huge beer drinker , but if i was , this place would be my go to .|&|sure there are other great places to grab a local ( or not-so-local ) beer , but how many of them are brewed and served inside of a church ?|&|The inside of this place was incredible .|&|I loved how they kept the church feel to the building , but then , of course , there 's all the beer .|&|This place is just a really great , different kind of place to go grab a drink and some food , and , if your lucky , arguably the best bartender in PGH .
We had a great experience at this dealership from start to finish .|&|Kasey was our salesman and he did a great job at making us feel appreciated , important and a priority .|&|My husband totaled his car so we were in a bit of a bind and trying to find something quick that was going to meet our wants and needs , and they could n't have been more helpful and understanding .|&|We bought a 2015 Jeep Renegade and we love it !|&|Thanks to everyone at this dealership who helped us over the past week !
It 's been about 2 weeks since I actually ate here , but better late than never , right ?|&|So I loved the setting at Urban Tap !|&|It had that hip , dare I say , Urban vibe to it , and it was well done .|&|Located right in the heart of South Side and conveniently next to a small parking lot , Urban Tap is , in my opinion the perfect spot for after work meet ups , happy hour , dinner.. whatever your mood may be .|&|Our server was totally on point .|&|He suggested the mojito for my drink and it was amazing .|&|For my appetizer I ordered the Brussel sprouts ( what else , right ? )|&|and they were great !|&|Not the best Brussels I 've had , but still really good .|&|For my dinner , I ordered the chicken sandwich , again at our servers suggestion , and just like the Brussel sprouts , it was n't life changing , but I liked it and of course cleared my plate ( no sense in being wasteful , after all ! ) .|&|We definitely enjoyed our evening at Urban Tap and I 'm already looking forward to our next visit : )
Love love love Earth Inspired Salads ( formerly Toss't ) !|&|They have a great variety of salad toppings , different kinds of lettuce , dressings ( the Miso Soy Ginger is my go to ) , and proteins to choose from .|&|The staff is always really friendly and quick , which is a plus since I only ever go there during my lunch break .|&|The inside is small but pretty cool , and there are a couple small tables to sit at if you want to eat there , but I 've always taken mine to go .|&|It 's a great little place and if you 're in the mood for something light and healthy , definitely try it if you have n't already .
We tried Wingharts for the first time a couple of days ago and loved it !|&|This was the first time Ive been to any Wingharts location , and I 'll definitely be going back .|&|I got the Dockworker Burger and my husband got the Shipwreck burger ( at the suggestion of the Bartender ) and we both loved them !|&|Ive said in one of my previous reviews that I 'm not much of a burger fan , which is still true , but when you try a place thats known for their burgers , I feel like you have to at least try one once.. and I was happy I did !|&|In my opinion , this place takes priority over Primanti 's and Sharp Edge.. yes I said it .|&|The fries are great and I LOVE that everything is fresh and made in house.. seriously an A+ move in my book .|&|Our Bartender , Rick , was awesome .|&|He gave us some honest suggestions when we inquired about menu items , and he clearly knew his stuff .|&|He was super friendly and gave us awesome service .|&|When we first came in and sat down , he said to us `` I 've never seen you guys here before , are you new to the area ? `` ..|&|SERIOUSLY LOVED THAT .|&|We 'll definitely be going back to sit at the bar , if for no other reason than because this guy was on point , and we loved it .|&|The only thing that was disappointing to me was that there were no signature whiskey drinks or specials..|&|They advertise that they 're a Burger and Whiskey Bar , but there 's absolutely nothing that draws me in to order any kind of whiskey drink .|&|I asked if they have any specialty drinks , and all of them were Vodka based drinks.. in a whiskey bar ?|&|Did n't like that , but it did n't bother me enough to give them less than 5 stars and to keep me from going back .|&|Although I 'd love to see some whiskey specials next time I 'm there !
A great friend of us recommend this restaurant to us , we had great expectations before we got there because of the reviews on Yelp , and guess what they were fulfilled !|&|The service is amazing because you never have to wait long for anything you need , no problem for water refills or rice refills , lol !|&|The egg rolls are small but delicious perfect for an appetizer !|&|You are gon na get a big surprise when you get your food , Can you say flavorful ! ! !|&|!
I ordered here for the first time because it was the only Chinese in my area that delivers .|&|I was impressed how fast the food came , still very hot and fresh .|&|Everything was good but my favorite was lo mein and kung pao chicken .|&|Portions were good .|&|It is the best Chinese I have had so far .|&|I recommend this place anyone looking to tryout good Chinese food .
If you want Awesome and Fantastic Service , call him , he will get to your home on time , he 's got this kind approach of understand you for your need to get your garage fixed and running .|&|We call his company to come and fix our Garage door expecting it to be expensive , but his price was perfect !|&|He 's fast and super professional when he does he 's work .|&|We 're so please we called him for his service , we feel lucky !|&|I would recommend anyone to call him and fix your garage , you will not be disappointed , you will feel like us , just lucky !
C'est dur de ne pas donner 5 etoiles a un cafe qui accepte les chiens !|&|: ) Ca m'est arrivee tellement souvent de m'etre faite refuser dans des magasins ou meme des terrasses que ca a vraiment ete un grand soulagement de decouvrir Lili & Oli .|&|Ils servent du tres bon cafe et des patisseries de chez Sophie Sucree si vous avez un petit creux .|&|Il y a bien sur du Wifi pour les nombreux etudiants et travailleurs autonomes du quartier qui viennent ici .|&|Malgre le fait qu'ils acceptent les chiens j'ai toujours trouve l'atmosphere tres tranquille- vu que c'est assez petit comme espace les chiens se promenent un peu pour dire allo aux clients et amasser des caresses mais ne courent pas comme s'ils etaient dans un parc .|&|Ce n'est par contre pas un endroit ou vous pourrez passer toute la journee parce qu'ils ne servent pas de repas .|&|Je recommande toutefois les terrasses de Gepetto Pizza et Burgundy Lion situees a un bloc du cafe- elles sont pet-friendly !
We 've heard rave reviews for a while now but have always opted against coming here since it is just so goddamn far .|&|Luckily , we were in the area last Saturday and decided to drop by for lunch .|&|Best decision ever .|&|It 's a byow , first of all .|&|Usually I am not too impressed with byob 's because the quality/price ratio tends to be pretty low , however Carambola is one of the few exceptions to the rule .|&|We devoured the braised beef Poutine with aged cheddar and the spicy fried chicken burger .|&|The perfectly crispy hot chicken was served in a soft homemade pretzel bun .|&|The Poutine was just out of this world .|&|Everything was tasty , delicious and balanced .|&|Verdict : it 's really worth the trip !|&|Ca n't wait to come back to try the dinner menu .
One of my favourite Yelp Elite events ever , hands down .|&|I was n't sure what to expect at first but since I love paintball I figured I 'd like Dodgebow .|&|It 's just as competitive , fast-paced and strategic except the hits do n't hurt as much ; ) Great in the summer especially , since you wo n't be sporting bruises !|&|The staff is so friendly and awesome- they gave us tons of helpful tips and kept us entertained with a variety of games .|&|I ca n't wait to come back to try the light saber classes and the secret new room that 's going to open next month .|&|Thank you again Mariko , Yelp and Dodgebow for organizing a great event !|&|May the odds be ever in your favour .
Love this little coffee shop !|&|Such a lovely and cozy place to catch up with friends or study .|&|They serve good coffee and homemade desserts .|&|We tried their bingsoos ; a refreshing Korean shaved iced dessert lightly sweetened with condensed milk .|&|The matcha one with smashed red beans is the perfect mid-afternoon snack .|&|It 's milky , fluffy and sprinkled with generous amounts of organic matcha powder and chewy rice balls .|&|Our experience was further enhanced by the owner 's cheerful disposition .|&|On a street chock full of dessert spots , this cafe definitely stands out !
This is the first time I have ever taken the time to review a restaurant on yelp .|&|I eat out all the time , so this says a lot about the quality of this restaurant .|&|Moreover , I am typing this on my Iphone , so you get the idea .|&|The meal was sublime , from start to finish .|&|We started off with a watermelon ricotta salad .|&|The fruit was juicy and sweet , the cheese was just salty enough and velvety , and it was served with thin slices of dehydrated ( ? )|&|tomatoes ... was quite the party in my mouth .|&|Then came the amuse-gueule , a delicate piece of smoked salmon cube , with delicious marinated cucumber and creme fraiche .|&|It left us wanting more and at this point I was already worried that the mains were not going to live up to my expectations , as the previous dishes were so spot on .|&|It was no easy feat but the entrees managed to surpass our expectations , especially the mackerel .|&|It was perfectly pan-fried , so crispy and tasty , with a tender centre .|&|I usually hate ordering fish at the restaurant because it is ALWAYS too dry but this fish was perfection .|&|It was served with fried kale and a foamy creamy sauce .|&|I could have licked the plate , and actually regret not doing so .|&|The only sub-par dish was the duck magret ; the sauce made of apples and pumpkin was overwhelmingly sweet and the brussels sprouts were pretty bland .|&|For the finale , we were given a pre-dessert in the form of a homemade chocolate cherry truffle with peppery cream on top .|&|It was just lovely , and at this stage of the meal we were wondering where we had landed , because the food was truly out of this world .|&|A chocolate verrine and lemon-orange creamy cake later graced our table .|&|Once again , it did not disappoint .|&|Service was a bit cold but very efficient and professional .|&|It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time , and I already can not wait to go back !
I love this restaurant !|&|I 'm surprised it only has a 3.5 rating on Yelp , but I guess my 5-star rating is strictly for the food as I 've never eaten at the restaurant .|&|My work has been catering breakfast from here for almost 4 years now so I 've tried a lot of items on their menu .|&|My favorites are the Western paninis and crepes .|&|Great quality and portion size !
You know how friends from out of town always ask `` What is the best place to eat Poutine in Mtl ? ''|&|And most of the time people will say `` Go to La Banquise !|&|`` , which ironically is right across from Ma Poule Mouillee .|&|To that question I 'd answer ditch the lineup and come wait here instead ( yup , lines are long here too ) .|&|But it 's so worth it , trust me .|&|First of all , they do n't skimp on meat .|&|It 's probably equal parts roasted Portuguese chicken , chorizo and fries .|&|Then there 's the spicy sauce .|&|And the San Jorge cheese .|&|Heaven for poutine-a-holics .|&|I shared the Louis Cyr ( half chicken +fries and salad ) and small Poutine with my bf and we were so full afterwards .|&|Long lineups , but you can skip the line if you plan a bit ahead and order by phone .|&|Small ( 10 tables at most ) but turnover is pretty quick .|&|If you 're only here for the natas then skip the line and head straight to the pastries counter at the back .|&|You wo n't be disappointed !
I love Verdun 's brand new doggy cafe !|&|We organized a Frenchie meetup here yesterday night and everything went super smoothly .|&|First off , the owner and employees are the sweetest .|&|They warmly welcomed our little pack of rambunctious Frenchies and made sure we were comfortable and did n't lack anything .|&|You wo n't find moody rushed waitresses here .|&|The dining room is long and narrow , cool yet cozy .|&|Our puppy crew took over one of their comfy dark leather booths .|&|The gym was n't ready yet but the staff was nice enough to let our dogs play in the room .|&|Apparently they will transform it into a real gym in the near-future , with a treadmill , hoops and other toys to tire your dog out ( which means better sleep for us ! ) .|&|To avoid chaos and respect timid dogs and owners in the dining room , dogs can only roam around freely in the gym .|&|I tried the Salty Dog and Bloody Hound cocktails .|&|Love the names , and the taste even more !|&|The drinks were not overly sweet .|&|The muttball open sandwich was tasty and filling .|&|Maybe I would have preferred a regular sub though , as I did n't feel like eating it with a knife and fork .|&|The dogs went nuts over homemade yogurt pups and treats picked off the doggy menu .|&|They even serve dinner if your furry bff does n't feel like cooking .|&|We ca n't wait to come back for brunch , for a drink or just to hang out !
I 'm not a huge fan of red meat , but I loved this place !|&|We live nearby and decided to try it out on a Thursday night .|&|I wanted to reserve on OpenTable but did n't see a convenient time so called them and they were happy to accommodate us at 7pm .|&|The place itself is nicer than I expected ( I was picturing an AYCE chain ) , with birch trees , brick walls and concrete floors .|&|We wore random clothes because we expected to smell like bbq afterwards , but the ventilation system is actually so efficient that we did n't need to jump in the shower after dinner .|&|You can order set meals for 2 or 4 people , or go a la carte .|&|We ordered their 3 beef bestsellers , spicy pork , spicy kalbi ramen ( can you see the pattern ) , Korean tofu soup , mushroom medley and Shishito peppers .|&|The food was delicious !|&|The beef cuts were premium and so tender .|&|They give you dipping sauces for your meats but honestly everything was so well-marinated that you do n't even need the sauces .|&|Just be warned though- they do favour quality over quantity as the portions were relatively small .|&|I also did n't care much for the ramen as their focus is obviously on the bbq .|&|For dessert we had the red bean fish pancake .|&|We grilled the `` fish '' and devoured it warm with scoops of sesame ice cream .|&|What more can you ask for ?|&|We 'll definitely be back !
This place definitely does not need another glowing review , but here it is anyway .|&|Sumac is Montr√©al at its best ; casual , super tasty food and cool vibes .|&|Picture communal tables and an amazing wine and cocktail list .|&|Great for pretty much any occasion .|&|P.S .|&|The harira soup is to-die-for .
I came here on a Tuesday night .|&|I 've been to Atwater Cocktail Club , the speakeasy attached to Foiegwa , many times now and loved my experience each and every time .|&|I knew their cocktail game was strong so was excited to finally try their food .|&|I left greasy and bloated , but beaming .|&|I had heard so many good things about their truffle spaghetti that it would have been wrong not to order it .|&|In addition to the pasta we had the bone marrow , chicken liver pate , market veggies , cheeseburger and in yolo let 's have a heart attack fashion we added extra foie gras in the burger .|&|It was the perfect love child of French bistro meets greasy diner .|&|The truffle spaghetti was salty , chewy , and everything you 'd want to eat on a cheat day .|&|The cheeseburger came with perfectly crispy fries- they also serve these next door at $ 3 a plate and are a must-have for late night munchies .|&|The patty sandwiched between pillowy brioche buns was juicy and simply lovely ( again , in an oily messy way ) .|&|The foiegwa was nicely seared but was not particularly memorable .|&|The music deserves a special mention as well- this place is awesome !
My parents live in the area so we decided to drop by for lunch on a cold Sunday .|&|The restaurant is tiny .|&|We were the only ones there at first but the place filled up quickly after our arrival .|&|The owner was extremely outgoing and friendly , going out of his way to explain the menu and Taiwanese culture to us in lots of detail .|&|He enthusiastically told us he was trained by a local celebrity chef in Taiwan and showed us the recipes she had published in a magazine .|&|Our conversation really piqued our curiosity and by then we were impatient to sample his cuisine .|&|It definitely did not disappoint .|&|The menu is half Taiwanese and half Japanese .|&|We tried the Taiwanese beef noodle soup , which consisted of perfectly al dente udon-like noodles chilling in a deep , rich beef broth ; the heavenly Taiwanese minced pork rice , which tasted like it had been simmering in its juices for hours ; crispy Japanese almond shrimps ; sweet and sour deep fried fish , and some kind of chicken katsu , although the sauce tasted a bit more like teriyaki than the traditional plum sauce .|&|Everything was fresh and flavorful , and the fried food was surprisingly not oily at all .|&|I personally preferred the Taiwanese dishes because it tasted like the kind of home-cooked meals you yearn for once you 've left the family nest , but I must admit the fried dishes were very well executed and would delight any tempura fan .|&|We finished the meal with a sample of the pancakes that are only offered on weekends : taro , sweet potato , custard and red bean .|&|It was the perfect end to a very enjoyable lunch .|&|I really admired how passionate the owners seemed , and thought it really showed in their cooking .|&|We will definitely be back .
This place is AMAZING !|&|Favorite dishes : beet/mushroom/quinoa patties with verde salsa , chicken marsala , pesto tortellini , buffalo chicken bites ... Bakery department is gorgeous , excellent espresso ... Today I visited and I wanted the buffalo chicken bites , but none were prepared .|&|The owner whipped up a batch right away !|&|Impeccable service .|&|I just love it !
This place has an amazing vintage vibe .|&|The burger is delicious- I recommend the Danny 's burger and onion rings .|&|I 've also had excellent ice cream there .|&|Highly recommend !
Dr. Rose is our beloved family dentist !|&|He is truly the best in Cleveland !|&|We HIGHLY recommend him !
This place is AMAZING !|&|We had : the `` green salad '' with feta , red onion , raisins , some kind of delicious nut and delicious vinaigrette ...|&|Simple burger which was perfect ... And the Sante Fe burger which blew my mind ! ! ! ! !|&|It is half burger half chorizo with grilled peppers and onions with a very spicy chipotle sour cream .|&|The best chipotle sour cream I 've ever had .|&|Service was quick , our glasses never even reached half empty .|&|Highly , highly , highly recommend !
Love this place , good prices and selection !|&|The owner is so friendly and knows his products !
Dave is honest and trustworthy .|&|He has been a lifesaver during the hot weather in Phoenix when our ac went out .|&|Thank you Dave
Ronnies Auto was highly recommended by a friend and I was n't disappointed !|&|Rick the owner is very honest and my car drives like she 's brand new !
Casey is the best hairstylist , have been going to him for years and am never disappointed !
Diamond Granite did a great job with my new granite countertops and sinks.I request a quote online and was called back that day and Chris came out within the week to give me a quote and go over samples .|&|The installation was so quick and the installers were so professional and did a superb job !|&|I love my new countertops and am so happy with Diamond Granite !
Simply Natural Nails did a fabulous job on my SNS dipping powder nails , which is a better and healthier nail option vs gel or acrylic .|&|Very nice people and customers , everyone was super friendly and happy !|&|Found my new nail spa
High end Italian food , in an unassuming tratorria style hideaway .|&|You 'll feel at home whether in jeans or business casual .|&|The korean born , italian trained chef , was totally hands on ; from the welcome , right through to the finish .|&|We had the five course prix fixe meal for two ; which for $ 45/person , had an abundance of choices and substance to tease the tastbuds and satiate our appetites .|&|Recommend you check it out , before word of mouth makes desireable reservations difficult to obtain .
First time here today .|&|I brought my husband who is extremely picky .|&|I was worried about his reaction to trying something new .|&|He got a bacon , sausage , egg and cheese sandwich that he was thoroughly impressed with .|&|I got the bacon , egg and cheese on some bread I had n't heard of .|&|It was so good I wish it would n't have ended .|&|Since we did n't eat there we stood and waited for out food and coffee .|&|We decided to buy some of the chocolates .|&|Since I am currently full I will have to update after chocolate consumption .|&|It is a quaint little shop with some amazing greeting cards and a lot of eye candy on the walls .|&|If you are in the neighborhood stop by and try it .
I have been to Firebirds many times and will continue to go .|&|It is a delicious steak house that has many other items that are great for the whole family .|&|We always start with the ranch rings .|&|They are perfectly breaded and crisp and come with a garlic ranch dressing that everyone in my family loves .|&|Every time we go my daughter ca n't seem to get enough of the wood fired salmon .|&|The best part is that the salmon is on the kids menu so it makes it a little more affordable .|&|For dinner I have had the Firebirds Chicken Pasta , it was creamy and full of flavor .|&|Cilantro Grilled Chicken breast that was perfectly cooked with the parmesan mashed potatoes I could n't get enough of the jack cheese sauce .|&|The Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon with mushrooms and bleu cheese was so good that when I was finished eating it I could only think that I wanted more .|&|My niece recently tried the Sesame Encrusted Salmon with the parmesan potatoes and fried spinach .|&|The salmon left the plate quickly between her and my daughter , who helped her eat it when her salmon was gone , the fried spinach was something of a mystery .|&|At first when the spinach enters the mouth there is a crunch and then it just melts away leaving a salty taste that soon disappears .|&|Odd yes delicious yes , it was great with the salmon , or at least my daughter thought so since I do n't like fish .|&|Mr C got the Baby Back Ribs and enjoyed them making a perfect mess of himself .|&|They brought him a warm wet towel to help clean up , thank you .|&|The Chile Rubbed Delmonico has this delicious rub that makes the meat melt in your mouth .|&|The meat itself is very fatty which I normally would n't even try but the rub gave it a flavor that was worth the fat .|&|Everyone in the family has tried this and most everyone has ordered it at one time or another .|&|To finish the meal we always get the creme brulee cheesecake .|&|The crunch sugar top with the soft and creamy cheesecake and the graham cracker crust with blueberries and strawberries and a strawberry sauce makes this a beautiful end to a perfect meal .|&|We have never been dissatisfied and have always received great service .|&|They have a great wine selection , with beers that satisfy my beer snob husband and coffees with liqueurs that help to end a meal on a high note .|&|The price is n't bad for the food that you receive .|&|Take family or friends and enjoy a night out .
This place is located in the Fry 's parking lot on 51st and Olive .|&|Do n't let that fool you .|&|We came in and it is clean and the staff welcoming .|&|It was our first time so we took a minute to look at the menu .|&|We ordered the open face carne asada supreme and 2 of the frybread tacos one with shredded beef and one with carne asada .|&|By the time we paid the food was on the counter for pickup and the dinning began .|&|The food was excellent .|&|The frybread did not get soggy and stayed crisp throughout .|&|The salsa came in a squirt bottle which was perfect for squirting onto there crispy chips .|&|The food was so much my daughter could n't finish but that 's ok since my husband was enjoying the food enough to finish hers off .|&|I must say I was impressed and happy that yelp had not steered us wrong .|&|We will be back .
My friend and I who do lunch dates are starting to try new places that neither has been to .|&|This was the first stop on our adventure .|&|When we arrived at this quaint and inviting establishment we were greeted with a smile and asked where we might like to sit .|&|The outdoor seating looked nice but since it was the middle of summer we went to one of the indoor areas .|&|We got the iced tea and the cheese plate to start .|&|It was a small cheese plate but it was perfect for 2 people to share .|&|The breads and cheeses were a great combination with the dried fruits and nuts .|&|I know that jams and honey are sometimes a part of the cheese plate picture but this was a small light taster to start .|&|The way we lunch is we both order an entree and then split it .|&|Today We order the Signature Strawberry Chicken Salad and the California Club , minus the avocado stupid allergies .|&|We informed the waitress that we would be splitting them so when they came out they were already split for us .|&|The first bite of the salad with that poppyseed dressing was so amazing that we both almost forgot about the rest of the food on our plates .|&|My salad was close to the potato salad so I accidentally got a taste and remember the rest of the food .|&|The potato salad is hardy and rich without being to mustardy .|&|It has bacon but it is not too overpowering and somehow still feels a little lite .|&|They had forgotten to take the avocado off so they immediately took it back and remade the sandwich .|&|I loved that you could tell that it was a new sandwich since some places take it back and try to scrape the avocado off when they forget .|&|They never get it all and so the benadryl comes out but I had no reaction .|&|The bread was this warm focaccia bread that I could have eaten all day .|&|The turkey was fresh , not slimy , with crisp bacon .|&|The meal ended up being too much for one sitting so we both had lunch for the next day .|&|We ended with the Red Velvet cake which came out looking so cute and tasting divine .|&|We have already talked about going back and refer people here quite frequently .|&|It is a little pricey but so worth it .
All I have had is the Mocha Latte and it was delicious .|&|I could sit there and look at the art for hours .|&|Now that I know about them , thank you Ashley L. , I might try breakfast or lunch there some time .
It was on the spur of the moment that we decided to try this place .|&|There was a wait and we were starving .|&|We almost decided to go somewhere else .|&|I am so glad we stayed .|&|My family loves pizza but I am not as big a fan .|&|I will tell you that if you love pizza you should try this place .|&|It was the best pizza I have ever tasted .|&|My husband loved every bite and agreed that it was the best .|&|Their homemade sauce was at the center of this delicious masterpiece .|&|We started with the spinach salad and the bread and oil .|&|These were perfect starters and both totally delicious .|&|We got the Italian Stallion and the Salvatore to share .|&|They were both delicious and I found myself wanting more .|&|My in-laws got the lasagna and the chicken marsala .|&|I was able to try both of these and they were also both delicious .|&|We got the plain cheesecake and the raspberry drizzled cheesecake as well as the cannoli .|&|They again were all divine .|&|The next day we all started discussing when we should go back .|&|I surely ca n't wait .
So my husband daughter and I went here on a Sunday .|&|Little did we know that it was supposed to close only 10 minutes after we arrived .|&|They were gracious and fed us well anyway .|&|My husband got the double burger with fries and salad .|&|Let 's just say the man can eat a lot but was not able to finish his portion no matter how badly he wanted to .|&|The fries were perfect and the burger was gone .|&|My daughter got the Arizona omelet with hashbrowns and pancakes .|&|She is not a big eater but quickly finished her omelet and one of the pancakes that was bigger than her head .|&|She decided to take the other pancake and her hashbrowns home .|&|I got the burrito with spinach , sour cream , mushrooms , and cheddar cheese .|&|I could n't believe how light and fluffy the eggs were and how perfectly blended the ingredients were .|&|The meal was fantastic .|&|I was extremely surprised at how good the food and service was even though we came at closing time .|&|The staff was the best and we kinda got taken care of by everyone .|&|I am going back there again but hopefully not as a nuisance .
I have been to 3rd Place twice now and have yet to be disappointed .|&|The service is always great , never waiting for refills and always a smiling face .|&|The food is fantastic and full of flavor .|&|Since everytime I have gone it has been with a large party I have had the chance to taste many different items off their menu .|&|In the realm of their burgers the French Onion Burger , the Black and Bleu Burger , and my husband had the AZ Foot Long Hot Dog , since I do n't like hotdogs I will take my husband word for it that it was great .|&|By far the black and Bleu Burger was my favorite the bread that they use was the perfect topping for this rich garlic and bleu cheese delight .|&|I too had the Grilled Sonoran Chicken and felt that the pancakes were a little off but enjoyed the flavor of the chicken and red chile sauce .|&|If I got it again I may ask for no pancakes .|&|I was able to taste the Texas Grilled Ribeye and felt that the seasoning was perfect for the steak , which by the way melted in my mouth .|&|Their signature Prickly Pear Glazed Pork Tenderloin was fantastic , I tried it even though I do n't normally like pork in any form and found myself drooling over my mother-in-laws dish .|&|It is always a little annoying when they over season meat that really should be allowed to shine on its own but here the Filet Mignon was seasoned just right to show off the beautiful cut of meat .|&|My 11 year old daughter sat quietly not commenting on her meal as she ate the Southwestern Seared Salmon .|&|Once she had cleared her plate , which she rarely does at any restaurant , she started telling everyone how great her meal was .|&|I think she was afraid that if she said anything others would want to taste her meal too .|&|Now to desert .|&|The banana pudding was so rich and creamy that I had to take at least one bite , followed by benedryl stupid allergies .|&|The cute little cookies and milk dish was a huge hit .|&|But the sampler truly shined .|&|The sampler comes with a slice of their Carrot Cake , Tres Leches Cake , and Texas Sheet Cake .|&|I do n't like carrot cake normally but tried it anyway and it was better than I remembered carrot cake , still not a fan .|&|The Tres Leches Cake was so rich and creamy that I was sad to see it leave the plate so quickly .|&|The Texas Sheet Cake showed how salt and chocolate should always stay great friends , I could n't seem to get enough of this rich salty sweet delight .|&|For those of you worried about the fact that it is a church on Sundays , and for all of the sinners out there that should beware , you may want to rethink and try this place again .|&|It is now football season and they do have hours on Sundays , though shortened .
Alright so my friend Ashley L. wanted to go here so the first thing I did was look at the reviews on Yelp .|&|Mostly good but a few bad ones .|&|I have to say that usually only read the really bad reviews so I can get a feel for what may be wrong .|&|I was especially interested in the ones that said the sesame chicken was not good since Ashley L. said that was her favorite .|&|So I went and decided to let her lead .|&|They bring out the hot jasmine tea to poor into these little cups .|&|I must say that on a cold ( well Arizona cold ) day this was fantastic .|&|It was full of flavor and a nice start to the meal .|&|We both ordered the sesame chicken lunch combo and boy was I in for a treat .|&|We started with egg drop soup .|&|This is not my normal favorite as I do not like tofu and it is usually unpleasant if I get a bite .|&|It is mostly the texture I do n't like but the tofu was smooth and tasted like the broth and so I ate the whole bowl .|&|Then out came the lunch .|&|I was not expecting this much food .|&|I can see why some people were put off by the sesame chicken as it is not prepared the way it is everywhere else .|&|It felt so much lighter and had more flavor than I could imagine .|&|It was a piece of breaded chicken with a light sauce and green onions over it .|&|It was excellent .|&|Ashley L. is not a fan of chicken but loves this chicken and I can see why .|&|It was perfectly prepared with no fat globs anywhere .|&|It was moist and cooked to perfection .|&|This came with fried rice on the side .|&|The rice was well cooked with nice crunchy vegetables mixed in .|&|There were to fried wontons that were perfectly done and not too oily .|&|I do n't like fried wontons usually because they make the mouth feel like is has been greased yuck .|&|These did not have that horrible side effect .|&|The egg roll was perfectly crisp without any of the guminess that can occur if not cooked properly .|&|Fresh delicious vegetable inside .|&|Now to the service .|&|I do n't know who our waiter was exactly because it felt like everyone was waiting on us .|&|It was n't terribly busy but there was great teamwork .|&|Our tea never ran out no matter how fast we drank it they always filled it before we could finish it .|&|Our water glasses always had fresh water and ice and our plates were cleared promptly .|&|It was almost eerie how things would appear and disappear while we talked .|&|We never felt rushed to leave and even after the check was on the table we were checked on frequently .|&|The price for both of us was $ 19 and was well worth the food and the service that we received .|&|I ca n't wait to become a regular here .
On the spur of the moment we decided to try some Korean BBQ .|&|Went with someone that had been to many a Korean BBQ , and the rest of the family .|&|Let 's start off with service .|&|There are only two women there doing the serving and yes it is a little slow , I will take slow service with a smile and a good attitude any day .|&|Now to the main event ... ..the food .|&|I do n't know what they use to season the meat but all I can say is YUM .|&|The Korean salad I could have eaten all day long and still wanted more .|&|The kimchi was perfectly delicious and quite the treat .|&|Now to the experience .|&|It was fun and drew out people that normally sit in a restaurant and eat with very little conversation .|&|Summary : fun , yum , happy service , a new regular is born .
So this quaint little shop is located in an area that does not do it justice .|&|We went in and it reminded me if my Nana 's house .|&|They greeted us when we entered and since it was n't very busy we got all the attention .|&|We ordered 2 of the Black Forest and 1 DaVinci .|&|It took a while to make but that was because he ( the man making the sandwich ) had to grab fresh baked bread and slice all the meats and cheeses for each sandwich .|&|So the Black Forest has turkey , ham and havarti with lettuce , tomato , and honey mustard .|&|Everything was as fresh as you could imagine no slimy meat .|&|The DaVinci had ham , salami , provolone , pepperoncini , lettuce , tomato , and Italian seasoning with olive oil .|&|My niece explained it as `` shear ecstasy dancing on my tongue '' .|&|We then had the lemon mousse in a chocolate cup with a strawberry on top .|&|It was so good and was gone within a minute .|&|We had a half a sandwich each to take home for later .|&|All in all it was great and I will be going back and taking friends .|&|I know that one person said that there were only 5 sandwiches but there were many more on the menu when I went in today .|&|The servers were exellent quirky yes but friendly .|&|I even asked about my iced tea but he said that it was his own mixture .|&|Great fun .|&|Went there again and got another dessert some sort of custard with whip cream and puff pastry with powdered sugar .|&|Yum
I love their bruschetta .|&|I love their salads .|&|I love their sandwiches .|&|I love their hot tea .|&|Oh and I love postinos .|&|If you want consistently good food and a great place to eat with friends this is the place for you .
I am pretty new to this whole sushi thing .|&|I have never liked fish .|&|Someone suggested that I try sushi , that maybe I would enjoy raw fish .|&|Yeah , like that makes any sense .|&|Well now I want to try to eat fish because it is healthy .|&|Blah blah blah .|&|So I try fish again , still not feeling it .|&|There is this movie Hiro Dreams of Sushi .|&|I watch it and it intrigues me .|&|So I grab my 13 year old daughter and say let 's try something new .|&|So we show up at Yellowtail after reading reviews .|&|Big thing I look for no food poisoning .|&|I am not as concerned about service because I feel service is what you make of it .|&|We do a couple of rolls ( jazz roll and something with avocado ) and for fun we dare each other to do the salmon nigiri .|&|What has been my problem all these years .|&|The waitress was wonderful .|&|I told her we were new to sushi .|&|She made us comfortable and helped make suggestions and ... ... and oh my gosh what a great first time .|&|So I know we are new at this but oh my goodness now I crave it .|&|I have been to a few more sushi places based on reviews from multiple forums and I just had to come back .|&|I have food allergies and the saddest one of all is avocado .|&|This place has more options for me .|&|Most recently we went and got the cowboy and jazz rolls along with tuna and yellowtail nigiri .|&|I was hoping to get my craving out of the way for a couple of weeks .|&|Nope now I want to go back and eat more .|&|So my biggest problem with the place is I keep wanting more .|&|The only thing I need now is some hot and sour soup .|&|I know that might be sacrilegious but even though I have enjoyed their miso the best I really would live some hot and sour with my rolls .|&|I do n't know if this helps anyone make a decision about going here .|&|I am converted and totally want some sushi right now .
This is the best place for accessories ever .|&|It is also good for those with OCD as everything is color coded .
I may be biased since this is where I work but I feel that there is a lack of positive reviews .|&|My daughter received services here and I was extremely impressed .|&|My daughter had surgery when she was 3 and we got some of the best care ever .|&|This is why I wanted to work there .|&|They came in to give her some morphine and even though she was 3 they listened to her concerns that the morphine made her head feel funny and that she did n't want it .|&|They called the doctor at midnight and got a new order for pain control .|&|That impressed me .|&|She currently goes to the pediatric clinic there and they take everything she says into consideration .|&|This is the only place I would ever take her .|&|I have had experiences with other family members and their kids at other pediatric facilities and this is where I always recommend anyone take their children .
Solid Home Renovations completed the remodel of our master bath and family bath in 4 weeks last fall .|&|We made changes during the process .|&|They were easy to work with and still completed the project on schedule .|&|We were 100 % satisfied with the results and knew we would use Solid Home Renovations again .|&|Last month , we completed the remodel of the rest of our home , including a new kitchen , new flooring and paint throughout .|&|The project was completed within 6 weeks and we are completely satisfied with the results .|&|I would highly recommend Solid Home Renovations .|&|M & J
Tonight we chose Elvira 's and we r glad we did ... my husband chose the oxtails and he loved them ..|&|I had the stewed chicken which reminded me of my moms and my cooking ... Elvira waited on us a very nice polite owner ... her husband prepared my watermelon drink !|&|I loved it ... 3 people can share it !|&|Louis the owner was very friendly and helpful ...|&|I loved the music and wanted to dance ! ! !|&|Please widen out and try Elvira 's ... you will be happy you did ! !|&|They are on Groupon 12 dollars for 20 worth of food .|&|Jerry and Cheryl
Lunch during the week is great here .|&|It is a laid back atmosphere , a mix of ole school music and really nice staff .|&|The food is really good , although I am stuck on the country fried steak , I have tried other items .|&|they serve good sized portions and it is reasonably priced .|&|Great choices of food .|&|this is close to work , service is fast ( not fast food fast ) but I can take my time eating and still get back to work on time .|&|very satisfying experience .|&|Just too bad there is n't a cot at work for the `` I have eaten well and am sleepy '' afternoon nap .|&|I will continue to eat here until everyone else discovers this place and it gets too crowded .
Professional , prompt service .|&|We got a quote on Friday to take out a large tree in the backyard that was dying .|&|There was not much difference in the price we had the received from another company except Chip Off The Old Block included chipping and removing the tree .|&|The office called Monday morning to confirm the crew was on their way , and they arrived shortly after .|&|Obviously these guys knew what they were doing .|&|The first guy climbed into the tree and methodically cut until there was nothing left but a trunk .|&|He knew how to bring it down so that the pieces fell right where he wanted them to .|&|I was very impressed .|&|The rest of the crew cut and dragged everything to the chipper in the front of the house so proficiently that they were completely done in less than 2 hours .|&|The area was totally cleaned when they left and we are very happy with their service .|&|We will definitely call them again when we need any type of tree service .|&|I would highly recommend them .
My husband and I spent one night at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas .|&|The staff was impeccable and courteous .|&|When we arrived to our suite we noticed the smell of smoke in the front bathroom .|&|I called the front desk and within five minutes we were moved to another suite .|&|The suite was very clean and the bed was very comfortable .|&|Over all all our expectations were met .|&|I would recommend this hotel ( separate from casino but with access to Mandalay Bay ) .
This place is amazing !|&|They have great food and service .|&|I love them beer called `` Four Peaks '' !|&|All food are just delicious !|&|And also , do you know they have a Russian style food ?|&|OMG !|&|You must try it ! ! !|&|Try this place out !
*My daughter dropped and cracked our Ipad air this morning and i was calling around to find a best price to get it fixed .|&|I stumbled upon this store in yelp search and their pricing was way better than any other shop I called to .|&|I was closer to their Tempe location , and saw that their business has already 5 stars in mesa .|&|I dropped it off with Alex in Tempe and after 2 hours came to pick it up .|&|Ipad looks like new now , the screen is fresh without any fingerprints or dirt .|&|Thank you so much , you have made my day .|&|I will recommend you to all my friends !|&|*
I love this place .|&|Girls working great !|&|They are sweet and professional .|&|Thank you for your job ! !|&|!
I loved it it was awesome .|&|It was great .|&|Love that food .|&|It 's authentic Mexican right off the grill .|&|It 's homey , it 's cozey .|&|It 's definitely worth the money , worth another visit .
I had a great experience overall .|&|I had the technician check my AC unit for leaks and freon while I was in AZ .|&|He did n't find any issues , and the inspection fee was very inexpensive , about 3-4 times less than what I would have paid at the dealer .|&|I love finding legitimate shops that wo n't `` find something wrong '' just to make a buck .|&|I recommend this shop to anyone in the Tempe / Mesa area .
I love eating at Mr Wong !|&|The Lemon Chicken is delicious !|&|As is the King Pu Shrimp .|&|I live and work a block away so I eat there often as they have a great lunch special .|&|They are always very friendly and make you feel welcome .
I love this store and went there today only to find out it was closed down to non-payment of rent !|&|Several other people showed up at the same time and we are all saddened by this by this news !
Very friendly employees .|&|I did n't catch the older gentleman 's name but he took the time to help me find the CHiPs Season 3 DVDs I came into get .|&|Thank you so much .|&|Also the Checkout lady was friendly and we had a nice chat about nicknames .|&|I will definitely go back to that store .
I love this Subway location because they have pastrami !|&|The employees are always friendly too !|&|If you 're ever in the area and want great service ( and pastrami ) or any other sub go here !
Today was my first time eating here !|&|I must say I was truly impressed .|&|The service was fast and the food was delicious .|&|I had 1/4 lb burger with American cheese , green chile , 1000 Island Dressing and pickles .|&|The family who owns it are very friendly .|&|I highly recommended this place .
Makes me miss the Midwest so much .|&|I ordered the paramaggedon on my last visit , and it was absolutely fantastic .|&|As of recent , melt has gained insane popularity , and why not ?|&|For the uninitiated , melt serves an insane amount of variations on the classic grilled cheese .|&|For as busy as they have become , they seem to always carry a non pretentious attitude , and the environment is always welcoming and cozy .|&|Along with the massive grilled cheese menu ?|&|Delicious sides , and buffalo wings .|&|They also have a full bar .|&|I do n't know what more one could ask for .
First time here as I was back home for the holidays .|&|I must say , I 'm impressed with all of the breweries that have been opening up in the Midwest .|&|Ale asylum is good stuff .|&|Went there last Friday and enjoyed a couple different brews .|&|Namely , the blonde ( not really my thing , but well crafted none the less .|&|) , and the demento , a pale ale with a firm taste , but really smooth .|&|It 's always nice to enjoy something that is n't an IPA , especially since here in California it has been the rage for what seems like forever .|&|Next time I 'm in town I 'll have to give the stout a try .
My fiance and I had a wonderful stay here this past March !|&|It 's in a beautiful part of the Old Port area of Montreal .|&|There are plenty of great shops in the area but it 's a bit far from the Montreal 'hotspots ' like Schwart'z or Au Pied de Cochon .|&|If you are having trouble orienting yourself , the wonderful staff is so incredibly helpful !|&|They directed my fiance , an avid record collector , to a fantastic record store .|&|I ca n't say enough nice things about the staff .|&|Everyone was very helpful and the concierge even managed to get us last minute reservation at Au Pied de Cochon !|&|The room was beautiful , very tastefully decorated .|&|The king-size beds are enormous .|&|The suite was quite affordable , especially when factoring in that it felt like a luxury hotel thanks to the wonderful staff .|&|I imagine it 's even better in the spring when the terrace is open .|&|We will definitely be staying here again !
This was absolutely amazing ! ! !|&|I found out why they say magic reinvented nightly you will have to go to find out .|&|He was very funny .|&|I would go every night if I could .|&|You have to go to watch Mat Franco .
Outstanding place to have dinner with friends , co-workers or quality time with a loved one .|&|Awesome atmosphere and most importantly Excellent Italian food served by a wonderful staff .|&|Generous portions , Prices are reasonable .|&|I just love everything about this place !
Best Fish n Chips in town !|&|Staff is friendly , made us feel comfortable .|&|Atmosphere was very inviting and the food was amazing .|&|Could very well become one of my favorite places for 2017 .|&|We stopped in on a night that it was raining but I am hoping next time to take advantage of the beautiful patio area .
First time customer and extremely happy with my choice to stop in .|&|Very nice , friendly and clean environment .|&|Sarah and her staff at the Broadview Hts .|&|location will make you feel like family from day one .|&|I 'm hooked : - )
Yes ! ! !|&|Finally a hotel stay that I could actually relax and enjoy myself .|&|From the moment we arrived we were welcomed with warm smiles and outstanding customer service .|&|Our room was clean and updated which made us feel right at home .|&|Breakfast was delicious .|&|I would recommend this location to all my family members and friends .
El Torito Taqueria Bar my favorite Mexican Restaurant .|&|Super friendly staff , Food is absolutely delicious .|&|Margarita 's are out of this world .|&|Reasonably priced .|&|Parking is limited so get here early enough for a spot .
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for salvaging a horrible meal at Armstrongs .|&|What a hidden gem this place is , tucked away in a strip mall at Thorn Run Rd/Beaver Grade Rd .|&|They close at 9PM , but stay open for a few extra minutes to let the late stragglers ( like me ) through .|&|GREAT business strategy .|&|The girls working there were easy on the eyes , but more importantly , VERY helpful .|&|Thank you for the conversation and welcoming me to the area !|&|Kip 's has great names for all the ice cream flavors ( like PENNDOT ROAD for rocky road hahahah ) -- mostly dog themed .|&|Some flavors rotate in season .|&|However , so as not to leave the customer guessing , there is a cheat sheet to show what is in each flavor .|&|Everything here ( except the no sugar offerings ) is made daily on site .|&|Prices were excellent and it 's a very inviting store .|&|I had a double scoop of a dark chocolate and fudge ice cream for under $ 4 that was out of this world .|&|Very creamy and clearly of a fresh flavor .|&|Nice benches outside too once it warms up .|&|Do you like ice cream ?|&|If yes , is it before 9 PM ?|&|If yes , do you have cash ?|&|If yes , DO NOT GO to Dairy Queen , Cold Stone , Baskin Robbins , etc ... GO TO KIP 'S .|&|5 stars and I will be back repeatedly ( weight loss pending ) .
Plain and simple , unassuming store front with no seating .|&|Since moving to PA ( Moon Twp ) , I 've sampled their meatball grinder ( err I mean hoagie ) and tonight their pizza .|&|Out-freaking-standing .|&|The guys behind the counter were super friendly , and the food stood up to the test .|&|Great bite to the pepperoni , perfect balance of cheese and a great sauce , and most importantly , a delicious crust that even my kids would eat !|&|Will give other pizza joints in Moon/Cory a test , but given the crap we 've had so far ( other than Giani 's in Cory ) , this pie is going to be tough to beat .|&|Well done guys !|&|Definitely coming back .
Place is amazing .|&|Great service , great food , friendly staff ... Would recommend this for sure .|&|Waiter gives great advice on apps/main/wine combinations .
This is obviously a well run and managed establishment .|&|We were well taken care of and the whole team works together to serve at a superior level .|&|The food was also incredible .|&|I enjoyed the short ribs which were tender , delicious and perfectly cooked .|&|The horseradish mashed potatoes were amazing but if you do n't like a little kick you 've been warned .|&|My wife enjoyed the trout and said it was a great combination of textures and flavors .|&|As a final not I would highly recommend the signature huckleberry marguerita .|&|All and all you get much more than you pay for at the roaring fork ! !|&|!
First time coming in ... Freddy n Andy really good people ... Defenitly recommend .. Will be coming regularly
Great Service would recommend anytime.. Freindly and fast.. Every time I come in they top off all fluids and clean my car
Had never been here but for my first experience I would defenitly be back ... Nick who attended me was very knowledgeable and helpful highly recommended for a good ice cream .
My washer broke from my apartments down the street .|&|Anyhow Oasis I highly recommend ... Steve is a great guy best service I 've had in a while is why I 'm even on here writing this review !|&|Thanks STEVE !|&|!
( Lids locker room ) Came in to get a Witten Jersey ..|&|Came out with one ...|&|Helpful staff great experience..
It 's a good thing I do n't live in AZ or else i 'd be here everyday .|&|Best Nitro Cold Brew and Avocado Toast in town !|&|When I come down for spring training I always drop in !|&|!
Tim takes care of our pool and has done a great job .|&|It was so nice not to have to deal with anything during the hot summer months .|&|No chemicals or testing to mess with .|&|He just shows up regularly and handles everything .|&|Highly recommend him .|&|He knows his stuff .
If I could give zero I would .|&|Sat for 20 minutes , the front desk had 6 people before me get served and could n't explain why .|&|Then a tech said put her with me , a lady that came after me complained and they switched me to someone else without reason .|&|This is poor customer service and it 's always in the evening .|&|Maybe I should complain loudly to get better service .|&|My money is green too .
Sooo over rated people , $ 11 ticket per adult for non riding what small rides they did have , was way to much for what was there .|&|Go early and you will see what i am talking about .|&|Christmas lights is a very short short walk thru some christmas trees decorated by local businesses , as for rides expect a short train ride , a slide , yes a slide is considered a ride , very small mini putt putt golf , a walk thru a 3d elf experience , thats it .|&|As for food , expect nachos and cheese , tiny bags of potatoe chips , soda cans , no type of christmas food such as hot cocoa , no gingerbread cookies , no funnel cakes ... nothing , its like a bunk fair to be honest a small boring fair , workers are very unwelcoming and act like your dumb when you ask questions .|&|We will not be back .
We could not see the screen because the orchestra ( Toronto Symphony Ochestra ) was on the stage and blocked our view .|&|We were in the very front row GG seat 67 and 68 .|&|Having paid $ 95 per seat , it was a very expensive movie to 'NOT ' see !|&|I recommend that the Sony Centre NOT sell the seats in the front rows and that they or TICKETMASTER refund our money .
I find this restaurant in the higher-priced range .|&|I ordered a large pho for pickup today .|&|In the area I can get the same meal for a much lower price , almost half of what it is .|&|The pickup took about 25-30 minutes .|&|.
So disappointed in the lobster mac and cheese : c The shells were literally tasteless .|&|No flavor at all .|&|No cheesey flavor .|&|The texture felt like is was reheated leftovers and the shells were mushy and easily broken .|&|The lobster is claw meat and did n't taste fresh .|&|Do n't recommend .|&|I feel ripped off .|&|I look at other peoples pictures of the same food , and mine looked nothing like it .
Wish I could give them 0 stars ! ! ! ! ! ! !|&|Never ever ever again .|&|I came in as soon as they opened the doors .|&|I had brought a large trash bag FULL of Abercrombie and hollister clothes only worn once or twice and in mint condition .|&|Much nicer clothes than what they were selling in the store .|&|We waited an hour and they did n't even check our bag yet .|&|Seriously ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! !|&|Its not even busy and I was one of the first people in there .|&|That 's not the killer .|&|So after another 30 minutes or so , they tell us that they ca n't buy anything from us because nothing is in good condition .|&|BULL CRAP .|&|So we go to get our bag .|&|Guess what .|&|They gave us the WRONG bag .|&|So we tell them .|&|They lost my bag .|&|They lost my freaking bag of clothes worth over $ 200 in good gentle used condition .|&|They apparently gave it to the wrong person .|&|They called and called them and that person wouldnt answer or return my clothes .|&|They probably kept it since so much brand name in it yet not good enough for Plato to buy .|&|They would n't do anything so we had to ASK for compensation .|&|They only have is a measly $ 30 .|&|screw you .|&|DO YOUR JOB RIGHT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !|&|I should 've gave it to donation or sold online .|&|AVOID AVOID AVOID selling here .|&|Do n't buy from them either .
I 've waited a while to write this review because I hate writing bad reviews.. but my love for my Himalayan cat , Bean , has propelled me to do so .|&|If you care about your pet , please DO N'T use Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic .|&|I am new to Arizona from Michigan and on my own , I found this place on the Web and decided to go with it .|&|My cat is all I have , and I care about him very much , and I am very angry with the lack of care this Clinic has for animals .|&|I took Bean into the clinic late January of this year to get a grooming .|&|My bill was over $ 300 for a haircut with sedation .|&|They offered me no `` new client '' special or anything .|&|They even quoted me a rate over the phone that was completely different than what they charged me .|&|I understand as a new client , certain vaccinations were required .|&|But telling me a checkup would be free and then charging me for it is NOT OK. Moving on.. Now , his lion cut , which was essential for matting prevention ( typical on a Himalayan ) , is n't a hard cut AT ALL to do , but was UNEVEN , and whoever did the grooming totally lacked attention to detail .|&|If I am going to pay that much for a grooming , at LEAST pay attention to my instruction ( I had even wrote down how I wanted the cut ) , and he had chunks missing .|&|Clipper ridges , and spots that were completely neglected .|&|No , my cat was not pretty .|&|I literally had to go home with the scissors and FIX his haircut myself .|&|If a cat is SEDATED , you can take your time .|&|THAT IS WHY I TOOK THE DAY OFF WORK .|&|That is why this clinic told me they would need all day with him !|&|Worst of all ... .|&|I took the entire day off work ( this translates to losing a day of pay ) so I could be available to pick him up when they were done with him , which they said `` sometime in the late afternoon early evening '' .|&|So I waited around Scottsdale/Tempe area .|&|I live all the way in Desert Ridge .|&|But they did n't even CALL me to tell me he was finished , as promised !|&|I dropped him off at 9am , and the day rolled by and it was going on 5:30pm.. finally I called THEM and they told me , apathetically , `` yeah , he 's ready '' , as if they were annoyed I was calling ( The receptionist - I should have got her name - all I remember was she was a little heavyset and blonde and around my age - but I was too furious , and she did n't even bother to notice , nor care when I said I was n't happy with the service , she acted as if she did n't even hear me ) .|&|Every question I had for her she interrupted me .|&|I go to collect him , and out of ALL THE EMPTY CAGES AVAILABLE in the back.. ( they did n't bring him out to me , they said he was hissing and needed ME to go get him ) , they put him in the one above an EXTREMELY HYPER Pit Bull .|&|I looked at all the other empty cages .|&|Are you kidding me ?|&|I was furious .|&|OF COURSE he is going to be terrified , coming off sedation and right on top of a loud dog with its tail wagging and barking like crazy..|&|I do n't care if it was due to how late I was showing up - that was completely the clinic 's fault .|&|Who would do that to a cat coming off sedation anyway ?|&|Complete ignorance .|&|I am spreading the word about this Clinic .|&|Everywhere I can .|&|Get some volunteers that have some animal knowledge , and also a desk clerk who actually looks customers in the eye instead of filing her nails .|&|Then she could see the tears welling up in my eye as I signed the credit card clip holding my shaking cat .|&|Not only was I robbed of my time , my money , my poor cat was traumatized beyond belief .|&|These people are a NO GO .|&|Do not take your animal here .|&|[ Now , Ashley , I have read your condescending remarks back to people who have a hard time with your Clinic .|&|I work in the airline industry you can guarantee I am spreading the word around about your clinic .|&|My job is LITERALLY to calm people who have anxiety flying in an airplane .|&|People of all ages from all over the world .|&|And your clinic ca n't even get it right with animals ?|&|UNACCEPTABLE .|&|My company is responsible for a large percentage of new residents who are looking for vets , dentists , schools , etc .|&|YOU NAME IT - anything that comes with relocation .|&|I refuse to keep silent about the mistreatment I received any longer .|&|Customer SERVICE and Customer CARE .|&|You 're doing it wrong .|&|Your long list of people who have attested to your `` good services '' because you keep your lobby clean does NOT make up for the experience I had - again , it all boils down to ignorance .|&|A company that CARES WHOLEHEARTEDLY about their customers - ( especially those who have no voice - ANIMALS ) - MAKE IT RIGHT .|&|It 's just that simple .|&|Learn how to really SERVE a customer - And your customers absolutely must be taken care of , they are typically worried and/or hurting over their animal - THEIR FAMILY MEMBER - Once you get the heart right , you will go very far .|&|Your success will lie in your heart , not your pocketbook .|&|Please note : You do not ask for `` a second opportunity to gain their trust back '' when you lost it .|&|YOU MAKE IT RIGHT . ]
This is a perfect place for lazy parents .|&|I am a regular at a lot of different kid places .|&|When my boys wanted to try Bounce World I was excited to bring them .|&|They wanted me to pay full price to play with my kids which I think is steep .|&|I have a 4 year old and essentially just chase after him the whole time .|&|So to pay $ 12 each is to much .|&|Especially because this place is pretty small .|&|I will take Bounce U any day !|&|!
The rules have really killed this place .|&|I am aware there is a risk when takin your kids to a trampoline park .|&|That 's why we sign a waiver .|&|Right away I was told I could n't jump in the same area as my boys .|&|I had to jump on the opposite side as them .|&|I came here to have family fun and that got killed right away .|&|I do n't see the point in doing a family activity you ca n't do with your family .|&|My boys could only use a small portion of the `` free jump '' area even though we have to pay the full price to jump .|&|This place used to be a lot of fun and now I will never come back .|&|That 's sad for me because I have been coming to sky zone for over 10 years .|&|Never again
Absolutely the worst experience that I have had dealing with ... ..EVER ! ! !|&|I walked in with an approval letter and they never called me back which they had promised by Mon .|&|Wednesday came around and no call not to mention they sold the bike that I was interested in .|&|Do n't bother with this place if you are serious about buying anything .|&|There is no such thing as customer service or honesty .
Placed a call in order for 2 chicken teriyaki and when I went to pick up there was only 1 so I waited for other ... the new one they made I had eaten and got horrible food poisoning ... throwing up & liquid diarrhea dripping in sweat and light headed for 2 hours practically dying with a newborn crying for me and a 5 year old at home !|&|Glade I made something else for my son and did n't give him some of my food !|&|This was horrible and I eat there alot ... prob never again now
Worst airport experience just about ever .|&|Had a flight on Swiss Air coming from Zurich with a connection to Philadelphia USA .|&|First problem was that the Zurich flight was 40 Minutes late .|&|That need n't have been an issue however if it were n't for the horrendous job the airport does of directing passengers who have connections out of the country and who do not need to go through Canadian customs .|&|We got stuck behind hundreds of people funneling into a corridor that carried people both to Canadian customs and connecting flights .|&|We stood in that crowd until some figured out that 90 % of the people were waiting to enter Canada and people with US connections could fight their way through to a line with no one in it .|&|UNTIL that came to a screeching halt down stairs where they were filtering people through customs and security to get US connections .|&|The we waited in a line of 50-70 people with one - count it - one security lane open .|&|A good 30 of those people - including us had a half hour or less to make connecting flights .|&|Evidently some of the airlines held flights to let passengers pass security .|&|We got through just in time to have made it to the gate only to find they had taken us off the flight because we were too late getting through .|&|next nightmare was trying to locate our luggage to get it out of the airport in order to get a hotel for the night .|&|Never did although Swiss Air did get it transferred to our next flight .|&|Anyway complaint about Montreal is the very bad management of traffic through the airport and the most inefficient , badly managed airport security process I have encountered in any of my travels anywhere .|&|Avoid this airport for international flights
Not happy at all me and the family Love Einstein Bagels and we had the worst experience at this location unfriendly staff they got all of our orders wrong we had to fix them several times if I could give them 0 stars I would
Stay away .far away .|&|This business is a Groupon business .|&|She has no regular clients .|&|She will void your Groupon unfairly .|&|She 's a scammer .|&|Gets paid by Groupon and will find any excuse to kick you out the door .|&|You could have a death in the family ... she 'll say ... NOT MY PROBLEM ... YOUVE BEEN VOIDED .|&|The she 's got another victim lined up .|&|Ignorant witch
This was a horrible experience !|&|We purchased tickets for the 9:30 AM shuttle , we arrived at the tour lobby by 9:10 , the bus , however did n't get there till about 9:40 , no big deal .|&|We then headed over to the mall where we would be transferred onto a more comfortable and larger bus .|&|We made a line , they processed us and gave us an ID sticker and we proceeded to make the line to enter the new bus .|&|We were probably 9th or 10th in line , we picked our seats , felt comfortable and settled in .|&|After the bus is about 90 % full , our name is called and we get pulled off .|&|For what reason ?|&|A different party brought an unexpected guest , therefore OUR accommodations were hindered to make way for other individuals who did not plan accordingly .|&|After we de-bus , we 're taken to a van that has already been cramped with people .|&|Upon inspection , my partner and I notice that we would not even be able to sit together , rather we would be expected to sit next to random strangers for a pretty lengthy ride .|&|Furthermore , the seats were fit for a first grader , not a grown man .|&|When we took this to the manager , he stated `` oh !|&|you want to sit together ? ? ''|&|Um ...|&|YES .|&|We did n't realize that was such a shocking request .|&|Ultimately , he was unwilling to accommodate us , so that was a day completely wasted .|&|Sadly , they did n't even offer us a lift back after all the hassle they put us through .|&|So be warned , you probably do n't want to waste your money on this tour unless you want to be treated like a third-rate human being .
This place was exactly how Brian 's review went .|&|They are like the sharks of dental they are more concerned about getting paid than actually doing the work .|&|Then they tele-market the hell out of you phone trying to get you to come back for another teeth raping .|&|My wife and I went there for cleaning and they managed to only x ray and examine her teeth in the 2 hours we were there and seemed to forget to do the basic cleaning on her teeth we left very disappointed .|&|They did n't forget to bill my insurance for everything they could think of .|&|I would highly recommend a different dentist .
They got my order wrong and I called multiple times to just have them not pick up and not even have a voicemail .|&|I hung up the third time after 10 MINUTES of not answering .|&|So now I 'm out my lunch order money and could n't even talk to an employee to make it right .|&|Obviously shows there lack of dedication to customers and efficiency if they did n't even know there phone was n't working , or maybe they want it that way !|&|Either way I 'm irritated and will never give this location my business .|&|Very upsetting .
The custard is okay , but the staff is horrible .|&|Never warm and welcoming .|&|We are never greeted with a smile , they never say thank you or have a good night .|&|If it was one person then i would totally give them a break but it is literally EVERY STAFF MEMBER.. Not to mention the tables are always sticky .
For such a big company I 'm surprised they would let this store have such horrible customer service .|&|I did n't get greeted at the door , I was LITERALLY the only customer in the store and not once did someone come over to me to ask if I needed help , if I was looking for something in particular .|&|It 's hard to believe that it was slow since it was on the strip , I know , but I 'll deff take my money and questions to the town square location .|&|I was so excited to go into this particular Sephora because I heard it was bigger and etc .|&|but wow !|&|I 've never been so disappointed .
So I 've only bought a few things from this place but let me just say besides there ridiculous prices in upset with the service .|&|We just walked by and heard the girls cussing there heads off .|&|Because that 's definitely how you get customers .|&|Shame on you .|&|My husband and I will never be customers of yours ever again just because of the low standards we encountered today .
They could n't even come over and say hi to us .|&|Very poor customer service , walking back to our car there was a sales man right infront staring at us and he couldnt even say have a nice night .
The lady was rude on the phone , and this company discriminates against dogs as well .|&|Which is actually banned in the state of Nevada .|&|I do n't care if I loved the house I looked at , which I did n't .|&|The carpets were filthy btw .|&|I would never rent from a company who puts rude customer service agents on the phone , makes everything 1000x more difficult , and discriminates against dog breeds ?|&|I 'll take my money somewhere else
Food is okay , however the service is horrible .|&|I can not believe how long we had to wait for a refill for my water .|&|There was literally two other couples in the restaurant and we had to wait forever .|&|There was so no staff on the floor for a good 15 minutes .|&|WE HAD TO GET UP AND GET OUR OWN !|&|Our waitress also forgot to ask our order , did n't even come to check on us .|&|Hence , we had no water .|&|Almost wanted to dine and ditch , but being in the service industry myself I did the right thing .
Came in , bought a truck with a tow package .|&|Took it for a test drive and double checked to make sure it had a hitch .|&|Talked price , had to renegotiate price , they took it to the back to `` detail it '' Got home and noticed the tow package was gone .|&|What , did it fall off ?|&|I 'd bet not .|&|Plus they tried to finance the truck with them rather than my credit union who waited a WEEK for the contract .|&|I had to call multiple times , they fired the guy who was financed it on a separate issue ... Shady ass shit going on here , go somewhere else .|&|Update- THEY STILL HAVE NOT FULLY PAID OFF MY TRADE IN ! ! !|&|THEY OWE 152 $ TO MY CREDIT UNION .|&|ALSO , Took my truck in cause the breaks were squeaking , only had this truck for a month , 400 $ warped front rotors replacement and new shoes .|&|Plus the 150 $ to replace the tow hitch .|&|WATCH OUT ! ! ! !|&|THEY DO BAD BUSINESS AND STEAL FROM YOU ! !|&|!
This dealership is great until the deal is closed and you take your car home .|&|Trying to get a return phone call from the service department or certain members of management is impossible .|&|We started out with a good relationship but it quickly deteriorated .|&|Today was the worst .|&|We drove about 25 miles ONE WAY to have our car serviced with them ( we had made an appointment ) .|&|We arrived early and waited .|&|Approximately 48 minutes past our appointment time , our car was still sitting where we had parked it and no one had even bothered to come inside the showroom waiting area and update us .|&|There was another customer inside waiting for her car and she had to call someone to tell them that she had no idea it would take so long for servicing her car and she had already been waiting for about 40 minutes .|&|There were staff members shouting and arguing loudly in the showroom , as well as out in the service area .|&|We felt very uncomfortable with this lack of professionalism .|&|We took our unserviced car and left .|&|Our intentions are to get our final oil change done that was part of a package we bought and then we are looking for a dealership closer to home for servicing issues from now on .|&|We do not plan to purchase any more cars from here , either .|&|We gave the one star rating only because there was no zero rating available !
I 'd been warned that Brit & Chips was n't all it was cracked up to be , but being in the area closer to 8 p.m. , I decided that it was too late to venture farther for food .|&|I should have kept walking .|&|I ordered the Orange Crush Hake and Chips from the counter , since it was n't immediately apparent if it was a place with table service , but when the order was put in for takeout , I quickly asked if I could eat there instead .|&|The cashier ( and server as I soon found out ) was obliging and quickly told the cooks that it was eat-in .|&|The whole transaction was in French ( which can often make a difference in Montreal ) .|&|The service was remarkably fast in getting the food to the table , but after that , the experience went downhill .|&|Although it looked great to start with , the food was incredibly bland , no matter how much lemon and tartar sauce I used .|&|I was okay that the server ignored me the whole time I was there ( the `` extra mile '' would have been to offer water and check in ) .|&|With eating out in restaurants much more frequently , I 'm inclined to tip generously for good service ( because the difference has become much more apparent ) , but I 'll only do that on the way out when I 've judged the service .|&|I do n't feel like anyone really did a good job , and when they all ignored me on the way out , suddenly I was n't inclined to part with any more money .|&|( I totally had it ready in my pocket for the tip basket too . )|&|When I left , I felt a funny feeling in my throat ( definitely from the food ) , but today it 's actually a full-blown sore throat .|&|I usually give glowing reviews but this restaurant needs the feedback .|&|I think people will be more forgiving of bad food if the service is great , but usually those go hand in hand , so maybe the staff have given up .|&|And even if that was a one-off night , a customer in the restaurant is still a person with money to part with , right up until they leave your establishment .
It 's very pretty and well decorated , but very short staffed .|&|My mom and I were nearby and decided to try it out .|&|It was very busy , but we did go on a Saturday so that should be expected .|&|We sat at our table for easily 15-20 minutes without being acknowledged by a waiter or waitress at all .|&|We ended up leaving before we could order because it did not seem like we would be acknowledged by wait staff at all .
While I LOVE Mad Mex , this one is to be avoided .|&|For whatever reason , they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions , I 've just not felt well after eating there .|&|Because it 's a BB , I just keep thinking I had to be wrong about that .|&|But after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues , I 've had to write this location off .|&|Go to Robinson instead ... ( Or BB , please , please get a new KM for this location ! )
We had a horrible experience with this company several years ago .|&|So bad that I tell people about it still .|&|The line from our house to the sewer was backed up because of tree roots from a neighbor 's tree .|&|South Side thought they could just snake it and fix the problem .|&|When they broke the snake in the line ( which we were later told by other plumbers was a HORRIBLE idea ) , the insisted it was our fault and wanted to bill us in the neighborhood of 10K to dig up our driveway and repair the damage .|&|We ended up paying someone else around 6K to do the job .|&|Unbelievable .|&|And they were rude and unresponsive to boot .
I have walked past this place many times and have always seen other people eating here .|&|It also smelled delicious .|&|My partner and I finally gave it a try a few nights ago .|&|The evening we went to Malee 's we found them to be quite busy .|&|I had a brief wait but was seated fairly quickly despite it being a fairly packed house .|&|Definitely give them a point for that one .|&|The dining experience is where this story takes a downturn ; but first , I have to say that our waitress was very courteous and professional .|&|I have nothing but good remarks to say about her .|&|Unfortunately , this is the last positive thing to be said in this review .|&|We ordered a stir-fry and a rice dish .|&|The stir-fry came out as an oily soup .|&|Literally the food was drowning .|&|It was incredibly unappetizing .|&|As for the rice dish , it was the unfortunate victim of extreme overcooking .|&|There was literal lumps of mushed rice in the dish .|&|What was served to us was pretty sad honestly .|&|I 'm not sure if it was an off-night for Malee 's , or if our experience was consistent with how they normally operate .|&|However , what I am sure about is that the experience was so poor that I am just not going to bother giving Malee 's second try .|&|The whole experience is laughable for the prices they ask .
Been here twice and both times the food was incredibly disappointing .|&|Salmon appetizer was a complete mess .|&|Burger was dry and salty .|&|Not going to bother giving it a 3rd try .
Horrible service ! !|&|Was never acknowledged and was never informed there was a waiting list .|&|I was waiting for a good 15 to 20 min after being told there was a list .|&|The guy who was working , at 6pm on Sunday December 20 , holding the list took my name and said that there were 2 people ahead of me .|&|He assisted other people after the fact I was already waiting before the others .|&|Now that was BS !|&|He took my name and number and said he was going to call when someone is available which should be about 45 min .|&|So I walked around for about 20 min and came back to see how much longer it would be .|&|I saw three employees talking and not helping any customers !|&|The guy with the list himself did n't say anything and sat his fat ass down with no apology !|&|He said that they were just now available !|&|That ticked me off even more !|&|I would like to suggest to get your phone elsewhere !|&|Horrible horrible service ... Never again going to this place !
Took my mom to MM for the first time on her birthday .|&|It was 10/5/14 ( a sunday after the panthers game ) .|&|They were busy and we were okay with waiting .|&|However , we waited an hour and fifteen minutes for two pizzas that we ordered .|&|After an hour and fifteen minutes , we only got ONE of our pizzas .|&|After our waiter ( who never gave his name ) came back and told us that the cooks would n't tell him where our pizza was , I asked him to get a manager .|&|The manager came back and said that our pizza had been dropped on the floor and the cooks did n't want to tell anyone and get in trouble so that it would be out in 6-8 minutes .|&|meanwhile , our waiter was going to bring my mom a birthday dessert .|&|After waiting for the second pizza for an additional 20 minutes and half of our party was done eating , I began to start on my pizza .|&|Half way through , I found a disgusting hair in my food .|&|Asked my waiter to speak to the manager AGAIN .|&|It took the manager ( who never gave his name either ) 10 minutes to come to my table and explain this situation to me .|&|Needless to say , we did n't finish , pay for , or take the meal home .|&|This place is disgusting , the waiters and managers are extremely unprofessional and if you want good service and pizza , visit the Myers Park location .|&|THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO .
This ploce is terrible .|&|horrible customer service .|&|On Thursday , November 20th , I called MULTIPLE times about pictures that I ordered online .|&|First , the girl with the attitude that I spoke to on the phone told me I might have to have them printed somewhere else because the order two people in front of me ordered at 8x10 and they ran out of 8x10 ribbon .|&|I ordered a 5x7 and ( 2 ) 4x6s ( No 8x10s ) .|&|They said they would know for sure when the manager came in at 2pm how long of a wait the fix would be .|&|I asked them to have the manager call me and let me know when she got in at 2 .|&|At 3:30 when I called THEM back , they told me they were still unsure and asked if I want to cancel my order .|&|I told them to cancel it but still to have the manager call me because I wanted to express my dissatisfaction .|&|NEVER DID I GET A PHONE CALL .|&|So today , November 24th , I receive an email telling me that my pictures are ready to be picked up ... HAHAHHAA , AS IF .|&|This place is a joke .|&|I understand things are n't perfect and machines break , but atleast have the decency to let your customers know or return calls when you say you will .|&|I live in the apartment right across from this CVS and trust me , I will take my business to the CVS 10 miles away before I step back in this store ...
Wow ... . Just WOW is all I can say .|&|Do I even have to give these guys a star ?|&|We have had issue on top of issue with this store .|&|I believe in second chances but even after their THIRD chance ... . joke is truly on us .|&|Refurnished our house with a new baby on the way and all this place has been is added and unnecessary trouble .|&|Everything started out fine .|&|We got a washer and dryer from here about two years ago ... NO issues .|&|Couple weeks ago ... Open a credit account with them so that we can get everything we need at once to move into a new place .|&|Ordered a new W & D and a 60 inch flat screen .|&|I was told IN the store , `` You 'll get an email two days before to confirm delivery . ''|&|Got that email ... Email says `` We will contact you by phone 40 minutes ahead of scheduled delivery . ''|&|We .|&|Never .|&|Got .|&|A .|&|Call .|&|When my fianc√© finally did get a call , it was the delivery men stating they were `` outside '' and would only wait 5 more minutes before leaving .|&|I was on the other side of town picking up our 7 year old son .|&|I called the delivery man back and politely stated that we were under the impression we would have a 40 minute heads up .|&|They , now , ( Not-so-politely ) said they could wait `` 15 minutes '' .|&|( I needed 30 to get home . )|&|I immediately called HHGREGG customer service and filed a complaint .|&|The lady I spoke with was nice .|&|Said she would call their supervisor and figure it out .|&|After about 7-8 minutes on hold , she assured me that they would be there within 15 minutes of my arrival home .|&|I get home and 10 minutes later the delivery men show back up .|&|I walk outside , ( keep in mind - 8 months pregnant and with my 7 year old ) to two men smoking cigarettes as they greet me , almost undressing me with their eyes .|&|( They are very lucky my fianc√© was n't there for that . )|&|They take about 15 minutes to get the washer and dryer upstairs , knocking it all over freshly painted walls .|&|( I 'm sure it 's not an easy job to move that heavy stuff , but it 's your JOB .|&|Please try a little harder . )|&|THEN - they try to get me to sign for the washer and dryer .|&|Ask them where our TV was ... said `` We do n't know anything about a TV . ''|&|I asked to see their delivery instructions and sure enough ... the TV was on there .|&|They pulled the TV off the truck and stuck the box in the middle of my living room floor .|&|( I was under the impression they would get it out and set it up - but I guess not . )|&|Signed for it and they left .|&|Was told `` We need 5s on our survey , please . ''|&|Awesome .|&|I 'll do you a favor and just NOT take it because there 's not a score low enough for the service we received .|&|To top it off ... . We went BACK and ordered a new couch .|&|Set up delivery for a time that we would be home .|&|They brought HALF of our couch .|&|Said they `` forgot the other pieces '' .|&|I 'm sorry ... . WHAT ?|&|How do you forget the product you 're delivering ?|&|So we had to make sure someone was there AGAIN today for the rest of our couch to be delivered by more unprofessional and seemingly improperly trained young men .|&|When we pay these items off , TRUST ME , when I say we are cancelling the store credit card .|&|We absolutely WILL NOT purchase from this HHGREGG or ANY HHGREGG ever again .|&|Nor would I recommend any of my friends , family , or reviewers to do so .|&|Spend your money elsewhere .|&|Even WalMart has better customer service .|&|Purchasing from here is just an expensive headache !
Let me first say that I am a huge fan of W Hotels and Starwood in general ... I always stay at the W whenever possible .|&|Which is why I was extremely disappointed in the customer service I received upon check in at W Scottsdale .|&|There was a misunderstanding about the rate we were booked for and when the manager Matt came out to address our questions/concerns , he was extremely unpleasant .|&|Even if he could not do anything to honor the rate we thought we had booked , a simple `` sorry '' or `` my apologies '' would have been all we needed to hear .|&|Instead , he was simply kept saying over and over that we booked it wrong and that it was our fault .|&|As I said , even if that were the case , at least apologize for the misunderstanding and be at least a little bit friendly ?|&|Is this not the hospitality industry ?|&|I normally do not complain and rarely write a poor review ( check my past reviews ) but in this case , I felt Matt was remarkably unaccommodating and I felt compelled to write this : ( .
The staff and chef here have an utter disregard for their clientele 's health and will lie to make sales .|&|Went into this place a while back and told them I had a gluten allergy ( celiac ) .|&|I specifically asked about the sushi seasoning and gluten in different ingredients , and they said , `` No gluten .|&|No gluten . ''|&|They served me a vegetable roll with tempura in it , gave me regular soy sauce ( which has wheat in it ) , and poured a thick , dark brown sauce all over my salmon roll , which I 'm 98 % sure had gluten in it .|&|I took one bit of the veggie roll and spit it out once I tasted the tempura .|&|I will never go back .
I will NEVER go back to this ridiculous place again .|&|And do n't think this is from one bad experience .|&|No , this is from not one , but two bad experiences .|&|First time I went I made the appointment I told them that my hair was dyed a medium chocolate brown and I wanted some caramel highlights .|&|I knew that having dye in my hair would not make the highlights exactly caramel , so my expectations were rational .|&|The instructor was present for the first five minutes then disappeared , until the student started to panic a bit and he showed up to shrug his shoulders a little then walked off .|&|In the end I was left with three toned hair , NO highlights , and my hair was fried .|&|I 've had highlights done before ( under similar hair circumstances ) and this has not happened .|&|I however did n't know that they had ruined my hair until I got home and realized what had happened ( better light ) .|&|I called them the next day to ask about what they could do for me , and all they could offer me was to come back in the next 7 days to have the colour corrected .|&|Which was unacceptable because I had to work and could not be in their salon in time , and besides my hair was already over processed to be dyed again .|&|The woman on the phone was not empathetic with me at all , and did not see the fact that not only was I out $ 100 , I was also now an extra $ 60 in the hole because I had bought some hair masks to treat my over processed hair .|&|They were rude and were not going to try and rectify the issue with me at all .|&|The second time was last September .|&|My friend was getting married and being the person that I am I gave Aveda Academy another chance .|&|I made the appointment almost three months in advance for a simple cut and style ( no colour , I learned my lesson ) .|&|The week of the wedding my Nana died so now I was going to a Funeral and a Wedding all in one weekend .|&|That Saturday as I walked to my appointment ( early in the morning ) I got a call from them telling me that my hair dresser had been in a minor accident , and that my appointment had been canceled .|&|I asked them if they had anyone to just trim my hair and give it a quick blow dry .|&|I expressed my sincere concern about the injured stylist , but then explained my problem of having the Wedding and Funeral .|&|After all this I received ZERO empathy and not even an iota of effort to try and help me .|&|So I was left wandering around the city trying to find a stylist , with a Wedding that afternoon and my Nana 's Funeral the next day .|&|I think that it 's a 50/50 thing there .|&|I have friends that have had amazing experiences there , and I 've encountered people who have had ones like mine .|&|So it 's worth it if you do n't mind a gamble .|&|Me ...|&|I wo n't be gambling with this place again .
So I read all these glowing reviews for Aphrodite Spa & Nails and thought it was worth a go .|&|My experience was not so glowing !|&|I used to live near the Danforth and frequented Urban Nails and was always satisfied with their service .|&|I thought Aphrodite would be a step up .|&|Well it was a step up in price , that 's for sure !|&|Here are the reasons I did not like this place .|&|1 ) The price was over $ 10 more for a mani-pedi 2 ) The Shellac colour selection was poor 3 ) My cuticles were ravaged and three were bleeding after 4 ) The nail polish was not applied across the whole nail .|&|You can clearly see the tips of my nails and the sides .|&|5 ) They did my mani-pedi at the same time , with out asking , killing the whole relaxing experience for me ... .leaning awkwardly to one side the whole time .|&|6 ) Adding the Shellac sky rocketed the price even further .|&|The last reason was I thought the employees were rude .|&|There was another client there and she was quite demanding , and it was painfully obvious that the nail salon employees were talking about her in another language , a la Seinfeld .|&|Needless to say I 'm going to go back to Urban Nails next time .|&|This place is not worth the money at all !
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - DO NOT GO !|&|Ordered a large pizza and bread sticks for pick-up and was told that it would be ready in 20 minutes .|&|I showed up in exactly 20 minutes and the girl at the counter said that they `` forgot to make the pizza '' but that they `` caught it '' and asked if I would mind waiting 5 minutes .|&|I said , no problem .|&|After 5 minutes the same girl said that they `` forgot again '' and asked me to wait another 15 minutes .|&|Since I was with kids I said that I could n't wait and to just deliver it .|&|I called to check the status after waiting over an hour since I left the restaurant .|&|They said `` it will get there when the driver gets there '' .|&|I explained the situation and the guy said again that `` it will get there when the driver gets there '' .|&|To this point , it has been one hour and forty minutes since I ordered 1 large pizza and bread sticks and it is still NOT here .|&|I will update if/when is shows .|&|I ca n't make this up .|&|12 minutes after writing the 1st post , the delivery guy finally got here and they forgot the bread sticks .|&|Called and finally got the manager on the phone .|&|He had to `` cash out a driver '' and put me on hold .|&|After 6 minutes he finally came back and I had to recap the ordeal because it had `` been a crazy night '' .|&|I recapped the ordeal for him , said that I did n't want anything in return and made sure that he knew that it was me that put the YELP review in tonight .
If it was possible to give a 0 Star Review they deserve it .|&|I am in awe someone has not yet died from one of the moldy air conditioning units .|&|I rarely get sick and in less than 30 minutes I was coughing and sneezing .|&|I had to leave the sliding door open all night to alleviate some of the smell and had a dream a coyote walked into my room .|&|When you think `` smoke tree bungalow '' think also of the words `` mold '' , `` weirdly placed tvs without remotes '' , `` broken A/C '' , `` sliding glass doors with minimal curtain covering '' , and `` meth den '' .
SUCKED ! ! !|&|The staff did not know what it was doing and my bacon , egg and cheese sandwich has NO , ZERO , Zilch bacon on it when I got to my office .|&|I will never go back ! !|&|!
Well , I have yet to visit their store but I did sign up on the website with my email and was ready to order 4 golf visors along with some golf balls .|&|The promo offers a 15 % discount and i waited and waited for my code that never came .|&|Called customer service and the very unhelpful person on the other end ended up hanging up on me .|&|I was not rude , I just wanted what was promised on their website .|&|Guess I will spend my money somewhere else , especially after seeing the other reviews here .|&|Good luck Golf Galaxy !
Do n't book here if you are allergic to smoke !|&|The whole hotel reeks of stale cigarettes .|&|Two people in our group walked into dirty rooms , and waited 2 hours for them to be cleaned .|&|We observed cockroaches crawling on the wall near the ceiling .|&|When I tried to use my coffeemaker , which seemed to be clean , it did n't brew .|&|When I opened the brewing basket to see why , it was full of stinky , curdled hot water .|&|Ugh !|&|Maybe they are under new management since the last reviews .|&|I will never stay here again !
Disappointed .|&|Did n't finish food .|&|Burgers were small and over cooked , ribs were burnt and cole slaw tasted store bought .|&|Fries were only good part but not saying much .|&|Maybe pizza are better choice ?
lets see .|&|where to begin ... . i have a 2016 honda fit and i have spent over $ 60 on past oil changes but this time i just wanted to get the basic .|&|I had a coupon for 19.99 and i wanted to use it .|&|The first gentleman who greeted me took my info etc .|&|when I told them what i wanted -again what they advertise and he was very persistent that thats not okay for the car and i have to sign a waiver and so on and so on .|&|Then he said `` okay im going to give youvsynthetic oil and a $ 15 coupon which brings the total to $ 40 .|&|Again i said no .|&|I thought that was the end of it ...|&|I go back to the waiting area .|&|Mind you theres nobody else there ... Zac the manager comes in and says `` my assistant said you only want the basic and i want to warn you ... '' seriously ! ?|&|i said please im fine .|&|He gave me attitude about it .|&|Not normal attitude and then slammed the door .|&|i was honestly blown away and called my husband shaking .|&|In the end they didnt charge me the $ 26 .|&|The assistant walked me out to tell me this .|&|And its the only reason i gave one star .|&|While im thankful for the free oil change its not worth my blood pressure going up like that right before i move .|&|A lot of these chains advertise one thibg and then try to upsell you on the spot .|&|I had just never experienced something quite like this .|&|Update .|&|After 300 miles of driving I just received a notification that my oil life is 15 percent .|&|Even though they put a sticker on my car saying service is n't due for 5,000 more miles .|&|My husband and I are pulling over to add oil .|&|I AM BLOWN AWAY these guys would put customers in harms way knowing I was driving across the United States .|&|Beware !
If you need any bagels ... please do not even attempt to visit this place .|&|I 'm not one to rip or walk out of a place but this place was horrible .|&|I stood at the desk waiting to be served , however the manager was more interested in telling off her staff for poor service .|&|Business lost
I 'll keep this simple and sweet .|&|Without fail , it takes three to four phone calls to actually get through to someone to place an order .|&|Then most of the time I get thrown on hold for over 15mins or even hung up on .|&|I live in a two mile radius of this store and delivery takes a good hour to an hour and half .|&|Not sure what the deal is here but this store never seems to have a line up out front , so I 'm a little confused as to why they struggle .|&|When we get the pizza it 's actually not so bad .|&|Tried it a few times and wo n't order again .|&|There are too many other good pizza joints close by
Needed a new Tv , so I went here .|&|Finally after 8 years it was time for a new tv .|&|Pretty standard stuff here .|&|Did research online , went to the store and purchased what I needed .|&|The service was meh ! !|&|The guy took maybe 30mins to find a tv that was in stock and one section over .|&|So after purchase the clerk said because of some sort of store policy , I had to lug my tv out of store myself and that I could not use a dolly or cart .|&|So as I dragged the tv out of the store they said `` have a nice day '' .|&|Not sure if it is policy or the clerk wanted to count his commission but I was pretty disappointed .
I wo n't ever stay in this hotel and strongly recommend everybody to stay away from it .|&|I do n't understand how the stars are given to the hotels but I 'm sure that the Pantageas hotel does not deserve 2 stars or even worst the 4 stars they are supposed to have as advertised .|&|I had a reservation for three nights , I LEFT an hour after checking in .|&|The pillow cases were clearly dirty , the guests staying there made me feel unsafe .|&|I was disgusted to touch anything in that hotel , due to the fact that I have the feeling that there is something else going on in that hotel .|&|I 'm warning you , this is the worst hotel and you will regret staying there .
Tip for the business .|&|TURN YOUR PHONE ON .|&|We get the disconnected signal every Friday we call .|&|Avoid this location with a ten foot pole .
I wish I can give this location no stars !|&|So i decide to go to this location to grab something to eat .|&|But if I knew that the guy that took my order was going to have the attitude he did I would 've just gone somewhere else .|&|10:47pm to be exact , I believe he was the manager .|&|He had a annoying ass face , like he did n't want to be there .|&|He was not polite at all , and looked like it bothered him when I asked what came in the shrimp tacos .|&|His answer was just what u see in the picture .|&|No manner at all !|&|I would say thank you and no response !|&|If he was manager that is just sad ! ! ! ! !|&|I just feel that workers should leave attitude and problems out of work and treat customers the way they should !
The worse customer service in my entire life !|&|I am literally trying to give you money and you still can not help me .|&|I am trying to upgrade to an IPhone 6 , 20 days early because my battery life after the new update sucks .|&|I have made 5 phone calls to the 800 number in which I got 5 different answers .|&|They keep telling me the store had to do the override .|&|I am gladly trying to pay them a $ 35 early fee for doing nothing and they still wo n't take it .|&|They say the 800 number has to note it and the 800 number says the store has to note it on my account .|&|So not only do they not want $ 199 for the phone plus $ 35 fee and my $ 100 a month business !|&|Fine , I will gladly go to Verizon after all these years .
I will NEVER buy another Ford ever , everything you hear about Fords are true .|&|I have had my Ford Mustang V6 since 2006 ( 2006 model ) .|&|Every month it was something new that was wrong with it.. mechanical and electronically .|&|So this Monday my car was back at the service department for a fuel pump sensor .|&|They called and quoted me over $ 500 for a $ 30 part .|&|No thanks , so i paid the $ 120 for them to go throughout my car to see if anything else was wrong with it .|&|Final report : new brake pads = $ 400 , fine .|&|NOTHING else was said on the paper work , NOTHING .|&|Flash forward two days , 10 pm at night driving 70 mph in the fast lane on the 95 .|&|My right front tire sounds like is about to fall off.. so i pull off the freeway ( going 10 mph ) to see if i had a flat .|&|My boyfriends father comes to my rescue since he used to work at the speedway .|&|My tire had RIPPED IN HALF ! ! !|&|The metal braiding inside of it was wrapped around my rim .|&|Come to find out ALL 4 of my tires were COMPLETELY bald !|&|$ 600 later for new tires ... My question is : HOW COULD THEY NOT HAVE TOLD ME ? ? ? ?|&|I paid them $ 120 for what !|&|And on top of that i could have been killed if i did not stop right away when i heard the noise ( quoting the tow driver ) .|&|I would never ever let this company touch a car again !|&|The next day i finally got rid of my mustang , such a beautiful car but not worth the money or my life .|&|I got a 2012 new honda because at lease i know that i have a dependable , safe car now .|&|Oh and wait for my call on Monday morning because you can bet i will chew someones head off ( *cough* service department ! !|&|) .
Horrible food , slow , over priced and rude !|&|No thank you , go to cheesecake next door and avoid the middle life crisis crew .
I am editing my review from a 4 stars to a 1 star because tonight was my final straw of screw ups .|&|I went to Ulta tonight to get some more Redken because it was on sale with that ad they said you also get a free pump ( cool , but whatever ) .|&|So when i went to check out and the cashier is EXTREMELY caddy ( like usually here ) so i kept our convo short .|&|But when she told me the told it sounded a little high , she seemed in a rush so i checked my receipt when i got home .|&|She put 2 bottle pumps into my bag without telling me then charged me $ 6 dollars for them !|&|For something i did not want or was told i was being charged for !|&|It would be somewhat ok if this was n't the second time in the row that they over charged me for something .|&|A few months ago the cashier with the same attitude charged me for the same nail polish 4 times .|&|They really need to teach these girls at the front how to be nice to customers and how to ring up items because it is getting really annoying to be over charged at the same store each time i go .|&|The only thing i will come back for is the Benefit Brow Bar and the salon , at lease those people now how to treat customers .
Waited 20 minutes with a reservation even though half the tables were empty .|&|Fianc√© ordered a Moscow mule ( which they were out of ? )|&|then ordered an Manhattan with no tonic water .|&|Manhattan came out with half the cup full of water , sent it back to then be told they can not and will not make it without water but still going to charge us for the drink that he sent back .|&|Then had to wait an HOUR for a glass of milk , really ? !|&|The food was flavorless with no seasoning and the waiter was no where to be found the whole night .|&|For four people it took 3+ hours and around $ 250 ... crazy .|&|Would never go back !
I really wanted to like this place but I was very disappointed with my experience here during the Taste of Cave Creek event .|&|I went to grab a glass of wine at Brugo 's and the lady working made fun of the way I pronounced Malbec ( I pronounced it mahl-bec ) .|&|The pizza was okay but I definitely wo n't be back due to my awful experience at this event .
If the rating was on food and atmosphere alone I would have given Patois 5 stars .|&|This was my second visit and the food once again did not dissapoint .|&|However , the overall service was such a dissapointment it completely ruined my night ( and that of my out of town visitors as well ) .|&|I made reservations for 8pm and on arrival was told it would be a few minutes late .|&|No problem ... .|&|I completely understand these things happen .|&|BUT.. 50 minutes later when we were finally seated at the literally the worst table in the place with no futher apology is unacceptable .|&|I have worked in service .|&|A sincere apology and perhaps a complimentary appetizer or dessert would have gone a long way .|&|Instead , after being seated when I said that it was little uncool I was met with a `` why , what did we do '' ?|&|I get Patois does n't care .|&|Why would they ?|&|They are really busy and have no shortage of customers on any given day .|&|It would have just been nice if they had at least pretended .
There was only one other table in the restaurant when we placed our order .|&|It took over 20 minutes to get the first roll out , then 20 minutes later the next roll came out .|&|By the time the last two rolls made it to the table ( which they forgot ) , the other 3 people at the table had finished eating .|&|The sushi rolls tasted ok but they were poorly wrapped .|&|The iced tea was horrible , do n't order it .|&|The menu is very limited so make sure you check it before coming ( if you still come ) .|&|I 'm not coming back , and do n't recommend even for a quick lunch .
We called Goettl 3 days ago and they have NOT gotten back to us !|&|Our heater broke , I called Sahara Air yesterday and they were at my house by the afternoon !|&|Where is this 1 hour response time ?
Let me start by saying that I have recently moved here from Portland , Oregon and the ice cream bar is set pretty high .|&|When I walked into PS all the ice creams were covered !|&|I asked if they were closing , I have never in my life seen lids on two cases of ice cream !|&|I want to see the flavors !|&|I tasted two flavors , I was so taken aback by the lack of a visual ...|&|I chose the Banana Nutella , it was good , nothing earth shattering .|&|I also requested a waffle cone , the lady behind the counter pointed to a small empty jar on the counter and told me they were out .|&|It was a cup only .|&|I would have liked to get a scoop of nuts on top , however , I saw no nuts on the menu and nothing on the counters !|&|The atmosphere in this store was horrible , uncomfortable chairs , awful decor , literally nothing visibly appealing .|&|I could n't wait to get out of there !|&|My two cents , when you have an ice cream store in the desert and it 's in the 100 's and you do n't have a line out the door your doing something very wrong .
POOR service .|&|According to hours on Yelp the business was supposed to be open but when I called I was told they were closed .|&|He offered to meet me though so I waited at his business for him to arrive .|&|Apparently he thought I was supposed to meet him at Walgreen 's , however I thought we were meeting at his business and we both sat at different locations waiting on one another .|&|There was a miscommunication and the guy called me back frustrated I did n't show up to Walgreen 's .|&|He called me an a** hole so I hung up .|&|I try to support local small business but not when I 'm called an a** hole over a simple miscommunication .
Very tight space .|&|Foods are below average , ribs are toooo sweet .|&|Guy waiter was not friendly at all , it seems he was pissed off with everybody .|&|Pricy for the foods .|&|Avoid this place at all cost .
When Turntable first opened , they were FANTASTIC !|&|However , they have now gone the way of every other health care provider in the valley .|&|Forget about reaching anyone or having any request taken care of in a timely manner .|&|Used to be able to get same-day appointments - now I have to wait weeks to see anyone .|&|Some of the health coaches there seem to be sullen and angry - about what I 'm not sure , but they are certainly not `` coaches '' any more .|&|Now I see my primary doctor - Dr. Gokal - has left .|&|He was wonderful .|&|So now I 'm wondering why I 'm paying $ 80 a month to get the same level of `` service '' I can get from any other health care provider here in Las Vegas .
If I could leave 0 stars , I would ! !|&|I got my nose pierced here a few months ago and took out the jewelry to clean and could n't get it back in for the life of me .|&|Came into the store to ask for assistance and they refused to even attempt to help me .|&|I will never go back ! !|&|!
Long wait for boring Mexican-ish food on styrofoam plates .|&|This is a mix between chipotle ( ordering system ) filibertos ( styrofoam plates & cups- not Eco-friendly ) and street cart food .|&|I had the fish tacos- not good .|&|The fish did not have a grilled appearance or taste and was a bit mushy .|&|Super lame pre-shredded cheese at this spot detracts from the quality as well as gross chips & nasty tortillas .|&|The same day I went here I went to happy hour at crescent ballroom and had amazzzzing fish tacos for $ 2 each that had flaky seasoned real grilled fish not this limp frozen mush .|&|I did n't realized how gross it was until 5 hours later at happy hour .|&|I must have ordered the same thing twice in 1 day because of how forgettable my lunch was .|&|Side of guacamole is super small !|&|This stingy cheap restaurant will not see me return .
I called to ask for an appointment for my dog who seems to have a uti .|&|Hey ask for my last name and once they heard I 'm a new patient they said they have no availability and offered to give me numbers to other vets in the area .|&|Who turns customers away ?|&|What if I was a walk in ?|&|Not helpful to my pets health !
This mall is the equivalent of metro center now-a-days .|&|Honestly I do n't recommend leaving your vehicle unattended .|&|This is the type of mall that the people with money avoid unless it 's a restaurant on the outer mall areas , or in n out .|&|The Starbucks here even sucks .|&|Probably the best thing is the shoe department in Dillard 's downstairs at the north entrance .
Well well who would of thought ! !|&|We were there for all most 2 hours to buy a new car .|&|The plan was to drive away with one but they tried to give me an education on internet pricing instead .|&|Trying to convince me that all internet advertised prices at any store are much lower than on sight pricing .|&|Remember I said advertised pricing ! !|&|Well there quote to me even after my trade in was n't close to the internet price same vin number and on the internet it stated 18 miles but in fact it was 185+ .|&|We walked out feeling like they were trying to scam us .|&|It was a terrible experience - I do not recommend going near the place !|&|!
The food was clearly microwaved ( ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides ) .|&|The fish was rubbery .|&|The wait staff , although nice , was very salesy always trying to `` add on '' something in a pushy way .|&|I asked for my check and barely ate anything .|&|I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his `` Best In City '' award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table ... a shame the award was from 2005 !|&|I guess a lot changed in 7 years ?|&|Do n't bother with this place !
Terrible service .|&|We were recommended this spot by a friend so we gave it a shot after a long day of apartment hunting .|&|We walked in and immediately got a good vibe from this place .|&|Good music playing , food smelled delicious , & we were the only other couple in the restaurant waiting for our food .|&|Unfortunately we waited 1 hour 20 mins until we called it quits !|&|Yes , over a hour !|&|We were too busy looking at the houses & a apartments we saved on our phone to even notice we were waiting that long .|&|The restaurant then had a little crowd and people started getting their food before us .|&|And trust , we played out every explanation ... there was no excuse for that terrible service .|&|Things happen , I know ... but at LEAST come to our table and let us know what the hold up is .|&|So disappointed .|&|I lowkey think they had a problem with us but I 'm not going to get into that !|&|Idk maybe they did n't , but you see , their service was so bad it 's got me making up reasons in my head lol I mean there is no other explanation for their trash service .|&|We walked out .|&|I 've been working on my temper too so I did n't make a scene .|&|I told my friend about their trash service and he then replied `` oh yeah , they are hella slow man .|&|I forgot to tell you that . ''|&|Lol Order ahead if you dare to go to this place .|&|We 'll find another soul food spot though .|&|MF got me hot ! ! !|&|!
Attention Everyone , PLEASE do not do business with THIS company ... I just did not have a choice because of my current home warranty !|&|WOW !|&|What a scam !|&|This company and HSA are in cahoots !|&|I just moved in into my house 2 months ago..|&|I had this house inspected by a LICENSED INSPECTOR prior to moving in .|&|Then 3 days ago I noticed a leak on the copper line leading into the house .|&|So , I called HSA ( BIG MISTAKE ) btw NEVER EVER DO BUSINESS with HSA , and they sent JOSH from A & R , who took one look and said `` I need to call HSA to get approval , I will call you first thing when I hear from them '' goodbye & have a nice day .|&|Fours days passed , NO JOSH !|&|NO CALLS , so I called HSA to check on what had happened to my claim , and according to a very condescending female on the phone `` BASED ON THE TECHNICIAN 'S REPORT YOUR CLAIM HAS BEEN DENIED BASED ON HIS FINDINGS , CORROSION APPEARS TO BE YEARS AND THE SOLDERING WAS DONE IMPROPERLY ! ... I just moved into house 9 weeks ago and was thoroughly inspected by a LICENSED INSPECTOR and NO LEAK was found .|&|Amazing how easy it is for individuals and companies to gouge on poor consumers .|&|Josh , you could have just , with all honesty , said to my face `` SIR , YOU NEED TO PAY ME THE $ 75.00 AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT BASED ON WHAT I SEE , YOUR CLAIM WOULD BE DENIED !|&|Thank you Technician oops SALESMAN JOSH , who proudly owns Rhodesian ridge-backs , for coming to my house and taking my hard earned $ 75.00 for simply looking at at pipe AND thank you A & R COMPLETE SERVICE for you know ... nothing !
My mother in law got very sick and had to cancel her appointment for her initial check up .|&|We were told that because the appointment was canceled less than 24 hours prior to her appointment , she was fined $ 25.00 !|&|What would they want us do , drag my sick mother in law across town just to make her appointment ?|&|This clinic 's priority is making money and not the welfare of its patients .|&|The individuals answering the phone are callous and unsympathetic .|&|AVOID THIS CLINIC , GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ... .
